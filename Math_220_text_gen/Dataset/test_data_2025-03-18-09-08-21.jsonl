{"problem":"The sum of three positive numbers is 1, and none of the numbers is greater than twice any other. What is the minimum of the product of the three numbers?","solution":"For any triplet of numbers $x, y, z$ that satisfy the conditions, let $t$ denote the middle number in size (equality is possible). The sum of the other two is then $1-t$, and since none of them is more than twice the other, the difference between them can be at most $\\frac{1-t}{3}$. Using the identity $u \\cdot v=\\frac{(u+v)^{2}-(u-v)^{2}}{4}$, the product of the two \"extreme\" numbers is greater than or equal to\n\n$$\n\\frac{(1-t)^{2}-\\left(\\frac{1-t}{3}\\right)^{2}}{4}=\\frac{2}{9}(1-t)^{2}\n$$\n\nTherefore, the product of the three numbers is certainly not less than $\\frac{2}{9} t(1-t)^{2}$.\n\nLet's examine the range within which $t$, the middle number among the three, can fall.

Therefore, the product of the three numbers is certainly not less than the minimum of the function $f$ on the interval $\\left[\\frac{1}{4} ; \\frac{2}{5}\\right]$, which exists since $f$ is continuous. It is also true that for any $t \\in\\left[\\frac{1}{4} ; \\frac{2}{5}\\right]$, the numbers $\\frac{1-t}{3}, t, \\frac{2}{3}(1-t)$ sum to 1, none of them is more than twice the other, and their product is exactly $f(t)$.

The general form of \\( a_n \\) can be written as:\n   \\[\n   a_n = 5^n \\cdot 10^k + 37\n   \\]\n   where \\( k \\) is the number of digits in \\( 5^n \\).\n\n4. **Checking for Primality:**\n   - For \\( n = 0 \\), \\( a_0 = 37 \\), which is prime.\n   - For \\( n = 1 \\), \\( a_1 = 537 \\), which is not prime (537 = 3 \u00d7 179).\n   - For \\( n = 2 \\), \\( a_2 = 5537 \\), which is not prime (5537 = 7 \u00d7 791).\n   - For \\( n = 3 \\), \\( a_3 = 55537 \\), which is not prime (55537 = 7 \u00d7 7933).\n   - For \\( n = 4 \\), \\( a_4 = 555537 \\), which is not prime (555537 = 3 \u00d7 185179).\n\n5. **Pattern Observation:**\n   From the above calculations, we can observe that as \\( n \\) increases, the terms in the sequence tend to be composite. This is because the structure of the number \\( 5^n \\cdot 10^k + 37 \\) makes it more likely to be divisible by smaller prime numbers.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   Based on the pattern observed and the calculations, it appears that only the first term, 37, is prime. All subsequent terms are composite.\n\nThe final answer is \\( \\boxed{ 1 } \\) prime number in the sequence.","answer":" 1 ","problem_type":"Number Theory"}

{"problem":"For a sequence $x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{n}$ of real numbers, we define its price as \n$$ \\max _{1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n}\\left|x_{1}+\\cdots+x_{i}\\right| $$\nGiven $n$ real numbers, Dave and George want to arrange them into a sequence with a low price. Diligent Dave checks all possible ways and finds the minimum possible price $D$.

In each step, if several numbers provide the same value, George chooses one at random. Finally he gets a sequence with price $G$. \nFind the least possible constant $c$ such that for every positive integer $n$, for every collection of $n$ real numbers, and for every possible sequence that George might obtain, the resulting values satisfy the inequality $G \\leqslant c D$. (Georgia) Answer. $c=2$.","solution":"If the initial numbers are $1, -1, 2$, and $-2$, then Dave may arrange them as $1, -2, 2, -1$, while George may get the sequence $1, -1, 2, -2$, resulting in $D=1$ and $G=2$. So we obtain $c \\geqslant 2$. Therefore, it remains to prove that $G \\leqslant 2 D$. Let $x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{n}$ be the numbers Dave and George have at their disposal. Assume that Dave and George arrange them into sequences $d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots, d_{n}$ and $g_{1}, g_{2}, \\ldots, g_{n}$, respectively.

Notice also that $\\left|h_{n}\\right|=S \\leqslant N$.\nFor the induction step, assume that $\\left|h_{i-1}\\right| \\leqslant N$. We distinguish two cases. Case 1. Assume that no two of the numbers $g_{i}, g_{i+1}, \\ldots, g_{n}$ have opposite signs. Without loss of generality, we may assume that they are all nonnegative.

Among the numbers $g_{i}, g_{i+1}, \\ldots, g_{n}$ there are positive and negative ones. Then there exists some index $j \\geqslant i$ such that $h_{i-1} g_{j} \\leqslant 0$. By the definition of George's sequence we have\n$$\n\\left|h_{i}\\right|=\\left|h_{i-1}+g_{i}\\right| \\leqslant\\left|h_{i-1}+g_{j}\\right| \\leqslant \\max \\left\\{\\left|h_{i-1}\\right|,\\left|g_{j}\\right|\\right\\} \\leqslant N\n$$\nThus, the induction step is established.

Consider the first subset, $\\{1,2,4,8\\}$. Say 2 is an element of $T$. Because $2 \\cdot 2=4$ is in $S, 4$ must also be in $T$. Furthermore, since $4 \\cdot 2=8$ is in $S, 8$ must also be in $T$. So if $T$ contains 2 , it must also contain 4 and 8 . Similarly, if $T$ contains 1 , it must also contain 2,4 , and 8 . So $T$ can contain the following subsets of the subset $\\{1,2,4,8\\}$ : the empty set, $\\{8\\},\\{4,8\\},\\{2,4,8\\}$, or $\\{1,2,4,8\\}$. This gives 5 possibilities for the first subset. In general, we see that if $T$ contains an element $q$ of one of these subsets, it must also contain the elements in that subset that are larger than $q$, because we created the subsets for this to be true.

What is the minimum number of adults who entered the park on that day?\n\n#","solution":"Solution\n\nTo find the minimum number of adults, we will divide the problem into cases:\n\na) Suppose it is possible to have 0 adults. Thus, the sum of the quantities of young people and children is 100. Consequently, if each child pays 1.70 more to match the contribution of the young people, we will have $2 \\cdot 100=200$ reais. Since the actual contribution of these people was 100, the difference $200-100=100$ corresponds to the extra contribution of the children. Therefore, the number of children is $\\frac{100}{1.7}$, which is not an integer. This shows that it is not possible to have 0 adults.\n\nb) Suppose it is possible to have 1 adult. Thus, the sum of the quantities of young people and children is 99. Again, if each child pays 1.70 more to match the contribution of the young people, we will have $2 \\cdot 99=198$ reais. Since the actual contribution of these people was $100-3 \\cdot 1=97$, the difference $198-97=101$ corresponds to the extra contribution of the children. Therefore, the number of children is $\\frac{101}{1.7}$, which is not an integer. This shows that it is not possible to have only 1 adult.\n\nc) To show that the minimum number of adults required is 2, it suffices to exhibit compatible quantities of young people and children with the data from the problem. Repeating the strategy from the previous cases of simulating the extra payment of 1.70 by each child, we can conclude that the number of children needed with 2 adults is\n\n$$\n\\frac{2 \\cdot (100-2)-(100-2 \\cdot 3)}{1.7}=60\n$$\n\nThus, with 2 adults, the quantities of young people and children are $100-2-60=38$ and 60, respectively. Note that $3 \\cdot 2+2 \\cdot 38+0.3 \\cdot 60=100$.\n\nTherefore, at least 2 adults are necessary.\n\nObservation: Assuming that $x, y$, and $z$ represent the quantities of adults, young people, and children, respectively, we can obtain another solution by writing:\n\n$$\nx+y+z=100 \\text{ and } 3x+2y+0.3z=100\n$$\n\nThen, it suffices to multiply the first equation by 20 and subtract it from the second equation multiplied by 10, obtaining $10x-17z=-1000$. From this, 17 divides $10(x+100)$. Since 100 leaves a remainder of 15 when divided by 17 and $\\text{gcd}(10,17)=1$, $x$ must leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 17.

{"problem":"Which are the regular polygons that can be dissected into regular polygons?","solution":"For an $n$-sided regular polygon, one of its angles is $\\frac{n-2}{n} \\cdot 180^{\\circ}$. Therefore, three regular polygons cannot meet at a vertex during the dissection, because even the triple of the smallest angle of a regular polygon is already $180^{\\circ}$. Thus, we only need to consider the cases where one or two of the angles of the polygons formed during the dissection cover one angle of the original regular polygon.\n\n![](https:\/\/cdn.mathpix.com\/cropped\/2024_05_02_84a8d7d92293b06af44bg-1.jpg?height=211&width=483&top_left_y=369&top_left_x=802)\n\nFigure 1\n\nFirst, let's consider the case where one angle of the regular polygon is covered by a single angle of the same size. The side of the regular polygon formed during the dissection will obviously be smaller than the side of the original polygon, so, as shown in Figure 1, a $\\frac{2}{n} \\cdot 180^{\\circ}$ angle will also form next to such a polygon, which must be filled with angles of regular polygons. If $n=3$ or $n=4$, then $\\frac{2}{n} \\cdot 180^{\\circ}$ will be $120^{\\circ}$ or $90^{\\circ}$, respectively, and as shown in Figures 2 and 3, the dissection is possible (in multiple ways). For $n=5$, $\\frac{2}{n} \\cdot 180^{\\circ}=72^{\\circ}$, which cannot be filled with angles of regular polygons.

This means we have a \\(16 \\times 16\\) block of 1s and the rest are 0s.\n\n4. **Good Rectangles:**\n   Any good rectangle must have a sum of numbers that is divisible by 17. Since the sum of numbers in any rectangle containing only 1s is not divisible by 17 (except for the empty rectangle), the only good rectangles are those that contain only 0s. Thus, at most \\(10^4 - 16^2\\) cells can be covered by good rectangles.\n\n5. **Lemma:**\n   We need to prove that in any \\(p \\times q\\) table, we can select disjoint good rectangles such that at most 16 rows are uncovered.\n\n6. **Proof of Lemma:**\n   - Let \\(S_i\\) be the sum of the numbers in the first \\(i\\) rows modulo 17.\n   - If \\(S_{i-1} = S_j\\), then the rectangle \\(X(i, j)\\) is good.\n   - Define \\(f(i)\\) as the largest \\(j\\) such that \\(S_i = S_{j-1}\\).\n   - Consider rectangles \\(R_1 = X(1+1, f(1)-1)\\), \\(R_2 = X(f(1)+1, f(f(1))-1)\\), ..., \\(R_t = X(f^{(t-1)}(1)+1, f^{(t)}(1)-1)\\), where \\(f^{(t)}(1) = 101\\).\n   - If \\(f^{i-1}(1) < f^i(1) - 1\\), then \\(R_i\\) is good. Otherwise, \\(R_i\\) is not a rectangle.\n   - Since \\(t \\leq 17\\), at most 17 rows will be uncovered.

This is exactly how the solution above begins, and the students who solved this problem are those who had the idea to introduce these conjugates.\nMoreover, several students mistakenly believed that $x$ and $y$ had to be integers, or even that the terms $x-\\sqrt{x^{2}+1}$ and $y-\\sqrt{y^{2}+1}$ had to be integers as well.

This helps in analyzing the problem using binary sequences.\n\n2. **Case 1: \\( n \\) is odd**:\n    - **Invariance Modulo 2**: When \\( n \\) is odd, the sum of the numbers (heads as 0 and tails as 1) is invariant modulo 2. This means that the sum of the sequence remains either even or odd after any number of operations.\n    - **Equivalence Classes**: Since the sum modulo 2 is invariant, there are at least two equivalence classes: one for sequences with an even sum and one for sequences with an odd sum.\n    - **Reduction to Constant Sequence**: To show that we can always obtain a constant sequence (all heads or all tails), consider a non-constant sequence. Divide it into maximal contiguous blocks of equal elements. Since \\( n \\) is odd, the number of blocks must be even (otherwise, the sum of the lengths of the blocks would be odd, contradicting the total length \\( n \\)). Therefore, there exists a block of even length. We can flip all the values in that block, reducing the total number of blocks. By repeating this operation, we can eventually obtain a constant sequence.\n    - **Conclusion for Odd \\( n \\)**: Thus, for odd \\( n \\), there are exactly 2 distinct sequences that cannot be obtained from each other by applying the given operations: all heads and all tails.\n\n3. **Case 2: \\( n \\) is even**:\n    - **Binary Sequence Transformation**: For even \\( n \\), consider the binary sequence \\( a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n \\).

This transformation helps in analyzing the problem in terms of permutations.\n    - **Operation as Permutation**: An operation (flipping two neighboring coins) corresponds to swapping two distinct neighboring elements in the sequence \\( b \\).

Let the vertices of the graph be $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$, and let the degree of $A_{i}$ be denoted by $a_{i}$.

This can also be stated as: no two neighbors of any vertex in the graph are connected. This implies that the graph does not contain a cycle of length 3. Therefore, it also cannot contain a cycle of length 4. If $A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}, A_{4}$ were the vertices of such a cycle in the order of their connections, then - since there is no cycle of length 3 - $A_{3} \\in \\mathcal{C}_{1}, A_{2}, A_{4} \\in \\mathcal{B}_{1}$, and $A_{3}$ would have two neighbors in $\\mathcal{B}_{1}$: $A_{2}$ and $A_{4}$, which is a contradiction.

Solution An elegant solution by Gerhard Woeginger is as follows: Suppose k  0. Let X be the sum of the distances of the points from the rightmost point.

Which is this four-digit number?","solution":"When the subtraction is written in the usual scheme, in the last two columns (1) the lower digit is larger than the upper one; here, therefore, we exchange one ten of the minuend for units, or one hundred for tens, so the difference in the units and tens place value is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\text { units: } & e=10+d-a=10-(a-d) \\\\\n\\text { tens: } & t=10+(c-1)-b=9-(b-c)\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nHowever, in the first two columns, the upper digit is larger, so the other digits of the difference are:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { hundreds: } \\quad s=(b-1)-c=(b-c)-1, \\\\\n& \\text { thousands: } \\quad k=a-d\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n( $k$ as the first letter of \"kilometer\").

Therefore, the largest digit can only be $a=t$, and from (7) $a \\leq 8$, and if we do not allow $d=0$ as the leading digit, then $a \\leq 7$.\n\nThen $b$ and $c$ are one $k$ and one $e$, and from (6) $b+c=10$, so $b$ and $c$ have the same parity; therefore, their difference is also even: $b-c \\geq 2$, so $c \\leq 4$ and $b \\geq 6$.

Similarly, the total number of votes for the Raven and the Cuckoo cannot exceed $18+13=31$, and for the Cuckoo and the Rooster, it cannot exceed $20+13=33$ votes. By adding these three results, we estimate the upper bound of twice the total number of votes. Thus, the number of jury members is no more than $(28+31+33): 2 = 46$.

Therefore, $\\cos \\left(x_{1}-x_{2}\\right) \\geqslant \\cos \\left(x_{1}+x_{2}\\right)$, so $2-2\\left(\\sin ^{2} x_{1}+\\sin ^{2} x_{2}\\right)=\\cos 2 x_{1}+\\cos 2 x_{2}=2 \\cos \\left(x_{1}+x_{2}\\right) \\cos \\left(x_{1}-x_{2}\\right) \\geqslant 2 \\cos \\left(x_{1}+x_{2}\\right) \\cos \\left(x_{1}+x_{2}\\right)=2 \\cos ^{2}\\left(x_{1}+x_{2}\\right)=2\\left[1-\\sin ^{2}\\left(x_{1}+x_{2}\\right)\\right]=$ $2-2 \\sin ^{2}\\left(x_{1}+x_{2}\\right)$, rearranging, the lemma is proved. We now discuss the cases. When $n=3$, if the three angles are $\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2}, 0\\right)$, then adjusting to $\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{4}, \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$, the value of $F$ increases from 2 to $1+\\sqrt{2}$, so we can assume $x_{1} \\leqslant x_{2} \\leqslant x_{3}$, and $\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}\\right) \\neq\\left(0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$. Then $x_{2}>\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, $x_{1} \\leqslant \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\leqslant x_{3}$. Smoothing $\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}\\right)$ to $\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}, x_{2}, x_{1}+x_{3}-\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$, by the above discussion, $F$ increases. Another smoothing transformation yields $\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}, \\frac{\\pi}{3}, \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$, so $F \\leqslant \\frac{9}{4}$. When $n \\geqslant 4$, assume $x_{1} \\geqslant x_{2} \\geqslant \\cdots \\geqslant x_{n-1} \\geqslant x_{n}$, then there must be two angles: $x_{n-1}+x_{n} \\leqslant \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. By the lemma, $F=\\sin ^{2} x_{1}+\\cdots+\\sin ^{2} x_{n-1}+\\sin ^{2} x_{n} \\geqslant \\sin ^{2} x_{1}+\\sin ^{2} x_{2}+\\cdots+\\sin ^{2}\\left(x_{n-1}+x_{n}\\right)=$ $\\sin ^{2} x_{1}^{\\prime}+\\cdots+\\sin ^{2} x_{n-2}^{\\prime}+\\sin ^{2} x_{n-1}^{\\prime}$ (where $x_{1}^{\\prime}, x_{2}^{\\prime}, \\cdots, x_{n-2}^{\\prime}, x_{n-1}^{\\prime}$ are $x_{1}$, $x_{2}, \\cdots, x_{n-2}, x_{n-1}+x_{n}$ in descending order). If $n-1 \\geqslant 4$, then there must be two angles: $x_{n-2}^{\\prime}+x_{n-1}^{\\prime} \\leqslant \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Continue using the lemma for the above transformation, at most $n-3$ times, the variable set can be transformed into $\\left(x_{1}^{\\prime}, x_{2}^{\\prime}, x_{3}^{\\prime}, 0,0, \\cdots, 0\\right)$. Using the result when $n=3$, we know that $F \\leqslant \\frac{9}{4}$, the equality holds when $x_{1}=x_{2}=x_{3}=\\frac{\\pi}{3}, x_{4}=x_{5}=\\cdots=x_{n}=0$. Therefore, when $n=2$, the maximum value of $F$ is 2; when $n>2$, the maximum value of $F$ is $\\frac{9}{4}$.","answer":"\\frac{9}{4}","problem_type":"Inequalities"}

At the beginning of each round, the player bets some coins on red and some on black (it is possible to bet nothing on one of the colors, and some coins can be left unbet). At the end of each round, the croupier announces which color has won. The croupier returns the bet on the winning color to the player, doubling the number of coins of each type in it, while the bet on the losing color is taken by the croupier. The player wants to have exactly three times as many coins of one type as the other (in particular, it would be acceptable for him to end up with no money at all). For which $m$ and $n$ will the croupier be unable to prevent this?\n\n#","solution":"Let before some round a player has $a$ gold and $b$ silver coins. Let's see what happens to $a$ and $b$ in one round. Suppose the player bet $x$ gold and $p$ silver on red, and $y$ gold and $q$ silver on black. Then, depending on the dealer's choice, either the number of gold coins will increase by $z=x-y$, and silver by $r=p-q$, or the number of coins of each type will decrease by these numbers. Clearly, $|z| \\leq a$ and $|r| \\leq b$ and any $z$ and $r$ within these ranges can be achieved.\n\nAssume $a>3 b$. Then the dealer can ensure that this inequality is maintained even after the round. Indeed, if it is violated by any choice of the dealer, then $a-z<3(b-r)$ and $a+z<3(b+r)$. Adding these inequalities, we get that $2 a<6 b$, which is not true. Therefore, if at the beginning the number of coins differs by more than 3 times, the dealer can make sure that they always differ by more than 3 times. The problem is already solved when $m=3 n$ or $n=3 m$. It remains to consider the case when $m<3 n$ and $n<3 m$. Let's try to find $z$ and $r$ such that the ratio of the number of coins becomes 3 regardless of the outcome. We form a system of equations: $a+z=3(b+r), 3(a-z)=b-r$. Solving it, we find: $z=5 a \/ 4-3 b \/ 4, r=3 a \/ 4-5 b \/ 4$. For $a$ and $b$ differing by less than 3 times, $|z|<a,|r|<b$. Note that if $a+b$ is divisible by 4, then $z$ and $r$ will also be integers. Therefore, in this case, the player can achieve the goal in one round.\n\nIt remains to show that the player can make $a+b$ divisible by 4. Indeed, by betting all the coins on red, the player can ensure that either everything is lost (which suits him), or the total number of coins is doubled.\n\n## Answer\n\nWhen $a$ and $b$ differ by no more than 3 times.","answer":"3n","problem_type":"Number Theory"}

First, note that not only did each throw exactly one snowball, but each was hit by exactly one snowball. Indeed, from the phrase \"the first threw a snowball at the one who threw a snowball at the second,\" it follows that someone threw a snowball at the second; similarly, it is established that each was hit by at least one snowball.

Since exactly one arrow enters each point and exactly one arrow leaves each point, the arrows form one or several cycles.\n\nConsider the cycle that includes the first child. Let the first child throw a snowball at child number $x$. Then child number $x$ threw a snowball at the second, the second at child number $x+1$, and so on.

Mark a point $K$ on the ray $AB$ such that $AK = AC$. Then the triangle $KAC$ is equilateral; in particular, $\\angle AKC = 60^{\\circ}$ and $KC = AC$.

By visualizing the net of the tetrahedron, we can see that the congruence of the faces is only possible if from each vertex, one edge of length $a$, one of length $b$, and one of length $c$ extends. This implies that opposite edges are equal. It is known that a parallelepiped (two) can be circumscribed around any tetrahedron such that the edges of the tetrahedron are the face diagonals of the parallelepiped. In this case, the parallelepiped will be a rectangular cuboid, since the diagonals of opposite faces are equal.

{"problem":"Into how many regions do $n$ great circles, no three of which meet at a point, divide a sphere?","solution":"1. **Define the function \\( f(n) \\)**:\n   Let \\( f(n) \\) be the number of regions on the surface of a sphere formed by \\( n \\) great circles, where no three circles meet at a single point.\n\n2. **Base cases**:\n   - For \\( n = 1 \\), a single great circle divides the sphere into 2 regions. Thus, \\( f(1) = 2 \\).\n   - For \\( n = 2 \\), two great circles intersect at two points, dividing the sphere into 4 regions.

Therefore, the number of those looking at the back of the neck will not change.\n\nThe soldier at the end, who was looking at the post, will not be doing so after the turn; conversely, if he was not looking at the post, he will be after the turn. Thus, the number of those looking at the post will either remain the same (was 1 and will remain 1), or increase by 2 (was 0, will become 2), or decrease by 2 (was 2, will become 0).\n\nSince the total number of soldiers is constant, the number of those looking at the face will also either remain the same, or increase or decrease by 2.\n\nAccording to the problem, the number of soldiers looking at the face was initially one-sixth of the number looking at the back of the neck, and then one-seventh. This means that their number decreased (and, therefore, decreased by 2). On the other hand, it changed by $1\/6 - 1\/7 = 1\/42$ of the constant number of those looking at the back of the neck. That is, there were $2 \\cdot 42 = 84$ people looking at the back of the neck, and 14 people looking at each other before the turn, which is $84: 6 = 14$. There were no soldiers looking at the posts. Thus, the total number of recruits is $84 + 14 = 98$.","answer":"98","problem_type":"Logic and Puzzles"}

Let the center $O$ of the given circle of radius $r$ be the origin of the coordinate system, and the given line be the $X$-axis. Let the coordinates of the given point $P$ be $(u, v)$, and the coordinates of the point $Q$ on the circle be $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$, then the coordinates of the projection of $Q$, $Q^{\\prime}$, are $\\left(x_{1}, 0\\right)$. Since $Q$ lies on the circle, it satisfies the equation:\n\n$$\nx_{1}^{2}+y_{1}^{2}=r^{2}\n$$\n\nand since $P Q^{\\prime}=Q Q^{\\prime}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\left(u-x_{1}\\right)^{2}+v^{2}=y_{1}^{2}\n$$\n\nFrom (1), solve for $y_{1}^{2}$ and substitute into (2), then rearrange and solve the resulting quadratic equation for $x_{1}$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nu^{2}-2 u x_{1}+x_{1}^{2}+v^{2}=r^{2}-x_{1}^{2} \\\\\n2 x_{1}^{2}-2 u x_{1}+u^{2}+v^{2}-r^{2}=0 \\\\\nx_{1}=\\frac{2 u \\pm \\sqrt{4 u^{2}-8\\left(u^{2}+v^{2}-r^{2}\\right)}}{4}=\\frac{u}{2} \\pm \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{2 r^{2}-2 v^{2}+u^{2}}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nThe distance $x_{1}$ (and thus the point $Q$) can now be constructed using the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nThe problem is solvable if the expression under the square root in the solution for $x_{1}$ is non-negative:\n\n$$\n2 r^{2}-2 v^{2}-u^{2} \\geq 0\n$$\n\nor, dividing by $-2 r^{2}$,\n\n$$\n\\frac{u^{2}}{2 r^{2}}+\\frac{v^{2}}{r^{2}} \\leq 1\n$$\n\nFrom this, it is clear that the points $(u, v)$ for which the construction is possible lie on or inside a central ellipse with axes aligned with the coordinate axes, whose semi-major axis is $r \\sqrt{2}$ and semi-minor axis is $r$.\n\nThe number of solutions for $x_{1}$ is 2, 1, or 0, depending on whether the discriminant of the quadratic equation for $x_{1}$ is positive, zero, or negative, i.e., depending on whether $P$ lies inside, on, or outside the ellipse.

(This is always possible if $P, R, S$ form a triangle; if $P$ lies on the diameter $R S$, the construction of $Q$ is simple, as $P, Q^{\\prime}, Q$ form a 45\u00b0 isosceles right triangle.) Let the line $P Q^{\\prime}$ intersect this circle at point $Q^{\\prime \\prime}$. By the theorem of intersecting chords:\n\n$$\nR Q^{\\prime} \\cdot Q^{\\prime} S=P Q^{\\prime} \\cdot Q^{\\prime} Q^{\\prime \\prime}\n$$\n\nComparing this with (1), we see that\n\n$$\nQ^{\\prime} Q^{\\prime \\prime}=P Q^{\\prime}\n$$\n\nBased on this, the construction is as follows. First, construct the point $Q^{\\prime \\prime}$ on the circumcircle of triangle $P R S$, for example, by measuring the distance $P S$ from $S$ on the extension of $P S$, and drawing a line parallel to $R S$ from the resulting point to intersect the circle at $Q^{\\prime \\prime}$. Connecting this to $P$ and drawing a perpendicular at the intersection with the diameter $R S$ gives the points $Q$ that satisfy the problem.\n\nThe correctness of the construction can be verified by reversing the above reasoning.\n\nFor a given point $P$, we get four solutions if the line parallel to $R S$ intersects the circle at two points, two solutions if it is tangent (since one solution point $Q$ and its reflection across the diameter $R S$ are both solutions), and no solutions if it does not intersect.\n\nLet's examine for which points $P$ the problem has a solution. A solution is possible if the line parallel to $R S$ at least touches the circle. Since the tangent parallel to $R S$ touches the circle at the point $E$ where the angle bisector of $\\angle R P S$ intersects the circle, the line is tangent for points $P$ such that $P T = T E$. Therefore, the problem is solvable if $P T \\leq T E$. However, by a known theorem about the product of segments of a chord, $P T \\cdot T E = R T \\cdot T S$, so the solvability condition is:\n\n$$\nP T^{2} \\leq R T \\cdot T S\n$$\n\nIn problem 698 (KML XII., 3. sz. 78-81. p.), we proved the following equality for the angle bisector of a triangle: the square of the angle bisector from a vertex is equal to the difference between the product of the sides meeting at the vertex and the product of the segments on the opposite side. Thus, the solvability condition becomes:\n\n$$\nP T^{2}=P R \\cdot P S - R T \\cdot T S \\leq R T \\cdot T S\n$$\n\nRearranging gives:\n\n$$\n\\frac{P R}{R T} \\cdot \\frac{P S}{T S} \\leq 2\n$$\n\nSince $P T$ is the angle bisector, we have:\n\n$$\n\\frac{P R}{R T}=\\frac{P S}{T S}=\\frac{P R+P S}{R S}\n$$\n\nThe condition can be written as:\n\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{P R+P S}{R S}\\right)^{2} \\leq 2\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nP R+P S \\leq R S \\cdot \\sqrt{2}\n$$\n\nThus, the problem has a solution for points $P$ whose sum of distances from $R$ and $S$ is not greater than the constant value $R S \\cdot \\sqrt{2}$. The condition is satisfied by the points on or inside the ellipse with foci at $R$ and $S$, semi-major axis $\\frac{R S}{2} \\sqrt{2}$, and semi-minor axis $\\sqrt{\\frac{R S^{2}}{2}-\\frac{R S^{2}}{4}}=\\frac{R S}{2}$.

The answer is (A). Let $P_{n}$ be the probability that the game does not end with the $n$-th goal (nor before).

{"problem":"1. Let $n$ be the sum of all ten-digit numbers that have each of the digits $0,1, \\ldots, 9$ in their decimal representation. Determine the remainder when $n$ is divided by seventy-seven.","solution":"SOLUTION. First, we will find the value of the number $n$, then it will be easy to determine its remainder when divided by 77. We will not directly add the ten-digit numbers described in the problem. The desired sum can be more easily found by determining how many times each digit appears in all the addends at the units, tens, hundreds, etc. places. We will then determine the \"contribution\" of each digit to the total sum $n$.\n\nIf the digit 1 is in the units place, then we can arrange the remaining nine digits in the remaining nine places in any order, except that we cannot place the digit 0 in the first place. We can place one of the eight different digits (any except 0) in the first place, one of the eight different digits (any except the one placed in the first place) in the second place, one of the seven different digits (any except the digits in the first two places) in the third place, etc. The digit 1 is therefore in the units place $8 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1=8 \\cdot 8$ ! times. ${ }^{1}$\n\nBy the same reasoning, we find that the digit 1 appears $8 \\cdot 8$ ! times in the tens, hundreds, thousands, etc. places. It appears 9 ! times only in the first position, because then we can arrange the remaining nine digits in the remaining nine places in any order - there is no restriction for the digit 0.\n\nThe contribution of the digit 1 to the total sum is therefore\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n8 \\cdot 8 !+8 \\cdot 8 ! \\cdot 10+8 \\cdot 8 ! \\cdot 100+\\ldots+8 \\cdot 8 ! \\cdot 10^{8}+9 ! \\cdot 10^{9}= \\\\\n\\quad=8 \\cdot 8 ! \\cdot 111111111+9 \\cdot 8 ! \\cdot 10^{9}=8 ! \\cdot 9888888888 .\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nThe digit 2, of course, appears in all the addends in the various places as many times as the digit 1, so its contribution to the total sum is double. The contribution of the digit 3 is triple, the contribution of the digit 4 is quadruple, etc. The number of occurrences of the digit 0 in the various places is different from the other digits, but we do not need to determine it, because the contribution of the digit 0 to the sum is zero. Altogether, we have\n\n$$\nn=8 ! \\cdot 9888888888 \\cdot(1+2+\\ldots+9)=45 \\cdot 8 ! \\cdot 9888888888 .\n$$\n\nWe could now determine the desired remainder by calculating the value of $n$ and dividing by 77. However, we will avoid the tedious multiplication and division of large numbers. From the expression (1), we see that $n$ is divisible by seven (because the factor 8! is a multiple of seven). Since $77=7 \\cdot 11$, the remainder of the number $n$ when divided by seventy-seven must also be a multiple of seven.\n\nWe will still determine the remainder of the number $n$ when divided by eleven. Trivially, $45 \\equiv 1(\\bmod 11)$ and it is easy to calculate that $8 !=40320 \\equiv 5(\\bmod 11)$. We can speed up the determination of the remainder of the number 9888888888 using a known statement: A number $\\mathrm{s}$ with the decimal representation $\\overline{a_{k} a_{k-1} \\ldots a_{1} a_{0}}$ gives the same remainder when divided by eleven as the number $a_{0}-a_{1}+a_{2}-\\ldots+(-1)^{k} a_{k}$. We thus get\n\n$$\n9888888888 \\equiv 8-8+8-8+\\ldots+8-9=-1 \\equiv 10(\\bmod 11)\n$$\n\nOverall, we get\n\n$$\nn=45 \\cdot 8 ! \\cdot 9888888888 \\equiv 1 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 10=50 \\equiv 6(\\bmod 11)\n$$\n\n(we used the fact that the product of factors gives the same remainder as the product of their remainders).\n\nThe remainder when the number $n$ is divided by seventy-seven is therefore the number from the set $\\{6,17,28,39,50, 61,72\\}$ that is divisible by seven, i.e., the number 28.","answer":"28","problem_type":"Number Theory"}

Draw a line through point $Q$ parallel to $BC$ (where $N$ and $L$ are the points of intersection of this line with sides $AB$ and $AC$ respectively, see Fig. 9.3a). Since $AM$ is the median of triangle $ABC$, then $LQ=NQ$. Moreover, $PT \\| AC$, so $PQ$ is the midline of triangle $ANL$. Therefore, $AL=2PQ=6$. Additionally, $QL \\| TC$ and $QT \\| LC$, hence $LQTC$ is a parallelogram, from which $LC=QT=5$. Thus, $AC=AL+LC=6+5=11$.\n\n![](https:\/\/cdn.mathpix.com\/cropped\/2024_05_06_f1014a27e7f65c25d39cg-1.jpg?height=380&width=505&top_left_y=2306&top_left_x=133)\n\nFig. 9.3a\n\n![](https:\/\/cdn.mathpix.com\/cropped\/2024_05_06_f1014a27e7f65c25d39cg-1.jpg?height=372&width=506&top_left_y=2304&top_left_x=775)\n\nFig. 9.3b\n\n![](https:\/\/cdn.mathpix.com\/cropped\/2024_05_06_f1014a27e7f65c25d39cg-1.jpg?height=385&width=505&top_left_y=2292&top_left_x=1432)\n\nFig. 9.3c\n\nSecond method. Draw the midline $XM$ in triangle $ABC$ (see Fig. 9.3b). Then $XM \\| PT \\| AC$, hence $\\triangle APQ \\sim \\triangle AXM$ and $\\triangle QMT \\sim \\triangle AMC$, from which it follows that $\\frac{PQ}{XM}=\\frac{AQ}{AM}$ and $\\frac{QT}{AC}=\\frac{QM}{AM}$, that is, $\\frac{PQ}{XM}+\\frac{QT}{AC}=1$. Substituting the values from the problem and considering that $AC=2MX$, we get $\\frac{6}{AC}+\\frac{5}{AC}=1$, from which $AC=11$.\n\nThird method. Draw the midline $MN$ in triangle $ABC$ (see Fig. 9.3c). Since $QT \\| AC$, then $QT$ is bisected by segment $MN$. From the similarity of triangles $APQ$ and $MXQ$, we get $\\frac{AQ}{QM}=\\frac{3}{2.5}=\\frac{6}{5}$. Then $\\frac{MQ}{AM}=\\frac{5}{11}$, from which $\\frac{QT}{AC}=\\frac{5}{11}$, that is, $AC=11$.\n\nFourth method. Write the Menelaus theorem for triangle $BPT$ and line $AM: \\frac{PQ}{QT} \\cdot \\frac{TM}{MB} \\cdot \\frac{BA}{AP}=1$. Let $BP=x, AP=y$. Then $\\frac{BT}{TC}=\\frac{x}{y}$ and $\\frac{TM}{MB}=\\left(\\frac{x+y}{2}-y\\right): \\frac{x+y}{2}=\\frac{x-y}{x+y}$. Thus, $\\frac{3}{5} \\cdot \\frac{x-y}{x+y} \\cdot \\frac{x+y}{y}=1$, from which $\\frac{x-y}{y}=\\frac{5}{3}$, that is, $\\frac{x}{y}=\\frac{8}{3}$.

Thus, $w=1$ or $w=2$.\n\nIf $w=2$, then $2000+200 x+30 y+4 z=2014$ and so $200 x+30 y+4 z=14$ or $100 x+15 y+2 z=7$. This would mean that $x=y=0$ (since otherwise the terms $100 x+15 y$ would contribute more than 7), which gives $2 z=7$ which has no integer solutions. Thus, $w \\neq 2$.\n\nTherefore, $w=1$.\n\nThis gives $1000+200 x+30 y+4 z=2014$ and so $200 x+30 y+4 z=1014$ or $100 x+15 y+2 z=507$.\n\nSince $0 \\leq y \\leq 9$ and $0 \\leq z \\leq 9$, then $0 \\leq 15 y+2 z \\leq 15(9)+2(9)=153$.\n\nSince $100 x$ is a multiple of 100 and $0 \\leq 15 y+2 z \\leq 153$, then $100 x=400$ or $100 x=500$ so $15 y+2 z=507-400=107$ or $15 y+2 z=507-500=7$. From above, we saw that $15 y+2 z$ cannot equal 7 , so $15 y+2 z=107$, which means that $100 x=400$ or $x=4$.\n\nThus, $15 y+2 z=107$.\n\nSince $2 z$ is even, then $15 y$ must be odd to make $15 y+2 z$ odd.\n\nThe odd multiples of 15 less than 107 are 15,45,75,105.\n\nSince $0 \\leq 2 z \\leq 18$, then we must have $15 y=105$ or $y=7$. This gives $2 z=2$ or $z=1$.\n\nTherefore, the integer wxyz is 1471. (Checking, $1471+471+71+1=2014$.)\n\nFinally, $w+x+y+z=1+4+7+1=13$.\n\nANSWER: (D)","answer":"13","problem_type":"Number Theory"}

The number of ways to choose a pair of cards is\n\n$$\nC_{12}^{2}=\\frac{12(12-1)}{2}=66\n$$\n\n2) Only one of the cards is a duplicate. Then it can be chosen in 12 ways, after which the second card can be chosen in any way except: (a) all duplicates (12 in total, including the already chosen card), (b) all cards with the same number on the red side as the chosen duplicate (11 in total, excluding the chosen card), (c) all cards with the same number on the blue side as the chosen duplicate (also 11). Thus, the second card can be chosen in $12^{2}-12-11-11=110$ ways. Therefore, in this case, there are $12 \\cdot 110=1320$ ways to choose a pair of cards.\n\nThus, there are a total of $66+1320=1386$ ways.","answer":"1386","problem_type":"Combinatorics"}

{"problem":"2. Floor's class consists of 16 students, including Floor herself. All students took a test with four questions. Each question was worth a (positive) whole number of points. Each question was either completely correct or completely incorrect; no partial points were given. The question worth the most points was exactly 4 points more than the question worth the least points. All students achieved different scores; Floor herself got everything correct. How many points did Floor score at minimum?","solution":"B2. 21\n\nThere are 16 students and $2^{4}=16$ possibilities for which questions can be answered correctly. Since this is the same and everyone has a different score, each combination of questions must be worth a different number of points. In particular, each question must be worth a different number of points. We will now systematically try to determine how many points the question worth the least can be.\n\nSuppose this question is worth 1 point. Then the question worth the most points is worth 5 points. There are at least 0 and at most $1+3+4+5=13$ points to be earned for the entire test, so there are at most 14 possible point totals. But we need at least 16 possible point totals, so this is not possible.\n\nSuppose the question worth the least points is worth 2 points. Then the question worth the most points is worth 6 points. There are three possible options for the number of points per question: $2,3,4,6$ or $2,3,5,6$ or $2,4,5,6$. The second option is not possible, because the student who answered the questions worth 2 and 3 points correctly would have the same score as the student who only answered the question worth 5 points correctly. For similar reasons, the first and last options are not possible: then the student who answered the questions worth 2 and 4 points correctly would have the same score as the student who only answered the question worth 6 points correctly.\n\nTherefore, we consider what happens if the question worth the least points is worth 3 points, and the question worth the most points is worth 7 points. There cannot be a question worth 4 points, because then the student who answered the questions worth 3 and 4 points correctly would have the same score as the student who only answered the question worth 7 points correctly. So the four questions are worth $3,5,6$ and 7 points, and we can verify that all possible combinations of zero, one, two, three, and four questions answered correctly yield different point totals. Floor therefore had at least $3+5+6+7=21$ points on the test.","answer":"21","problem_type":"Number Theory"}

{"problem":"14th CanMO 1982 Problem 3 What is the smallest number of points in n-dimensional space R n such that every point of R n is an irrational distance from at least one of the points. Solution","solution":": n = 1 number is 2. For n > 1, number is 3. The result for n = 1 is obvious. The result for n > 1 follows from the fact that we can choose three collinear points A, M, B such that the distance of any point P from one of them is irrational. We can take a plane through P and A, M, B so the number of dimensions is unimportant. Let M be the midpoint of AB. Let PA = a, PB = b, PM = d, and AM = c. Let angle PMA = x. Then the cosine rule gives a 2 = d 2 + c 2 - 2dc cos x, b 2 = d 2 + c 2 + 2dc cos x. So, adding, a 2 + b 2 = 2d 2 + 2c 2 , so d 2 = (a 2 + b 2 )\/2 - c 2 . Thus if we take c 2 to be irrational, then if a and b are rational, d 2 , and hence d, is irrational. 14th CanMO 1982 \u00a9 John Scholes jscholes@kalva.demon.co.uk 21 June 2002","answer":"3","problem_type":"Number Theory"}

How many days at minimum must the performance be scheduled for?","solution":"[Solution] Let $N=\\{1,2, \\cdots, n\\}$ be the set of performance dates.\nEach theater group can be represented by a subset $A \\subset N$: Theater group $A$ performs on day $x$ if and only if $x \\in A$.\n\nFor two theater groups $A$ and $B$ to watch each other's performances at least once, there must be at least one day that belongs to $B$ but not to $A$, and another day that belongs to $A$ but not to $B$. Therefore, $A \\subseteq B$ or $B \\subseteq A$ cannot hold, and in particular, $A \\neq B$. Thus, different theater groups must have different subsets of performance dates.\nWe first prove that $n=6$ is sufficient.\nIndeed, one possible set of performance dates for 11 theater groups is:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\{1,2\\},\\{1,3\\},\\{1,4\\},\\{1,5\\},\\{2,3\\}, \\\\\n\\{2,4\\},\\{2,5\\},\\{3,4\\},\\{3,5\\},\\{4,5\\},\\{6\\} .\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThis is exactly 11 subsets of the date set $N=\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$, and no two subsets are contained in each other.\n\nNext, we prove that $n=5$ is not sufficient. Because each theater group's set of performance dates $A \\subset\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$, and clearly $1 \\leqslant|A| \\leqslant 4$ (where $|A|$ denotes the number of elements in set $A$).\n\nDefine a chain as a sequence $A_{1} \\subset A_{2} \\subset A_{3} \\subset A_{4}$, where $\\left|A_{i}\\right|=i, 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant 4$.

Therefore, the number of such chains is 120. Each subset with 1 or 4 elements appears in $4 \\times 3 \\times 2=24$ chains, and each subset with 2 or 3 elements appears in $2 \\times 3 \\times 2=12$ chains (for example, $A_{2}$ contains two numbers, $A_{1}$ contains one of these two numbers, $A_{3}$ contains one of the other three numbers, and $A_{4}$ contains one of the remaining two numbers). Since we have 11 theater groups, each group's set of performance dates appears 12 or 24 times in the 120 chains, so the 11 sets of performance dates appear at least $11 \\times 12=132$ times in total. By the pigeonhole principle, at least two sets of performance dates must appear in the same chain, denoted as $A$ and $B$, which contradicts the fact that $A$ and $B$ do not contain each other.\nTherefore, such an arrangement requires at least 6 days.","answer":"6","problem_type":"Combinatorics"}

{"problem":"7.5. Petya has 4 Soviet copper coins - one each of 1, 2, 3, and 5 kopecks.

Will he be able to do this if he has only one 9-gram weight?","solution":"Answer: It will. Solution: Let $x$ be the weight of a 1-kopeck coin, $y$ be the weight of a 2-kopeck coin. If the fact being checked is true, then $(x+y)$ is the weight of a 3-kopeck coin, and ($x+2y$) is the weight of a 5-kopeck coin. To verify this, we will perform two weighings: 1) 1 kopeck + 2 kopecks = 3 kopecks (?); 2) 2 kopecks + 3 kopecks = 5 kopecks (?). If at least one of these equalities does not hold (the scales are not in balance), then the fact being checked is false. If the equalities hold, we will verify by performing two more weighings the following equalities: 1 kopeck + 3 kopecks + 5 kopecks = 9 grams (?), and 2 kopecks + 3 kopecks + 5 kopecks = 1 kopeck + 9 grams (?). If at least one of these equalities does not hold, then the fact being checked is false. If both equalities hold, we have two equations: $x+x+y+x+2y=9$ and $y+x+y+x+2y=9+x$, from which we get $x=1, y=2$, i.e., the fact being checked is true.","answer":"1,2","problem_type":"Logic and Puzzles"}

On the other hand area can be calculated using Heron's formula::\n\n$$\n[A B C]^{2}=s(s-2 a)(s-b)(s-b)=(b+a)(b-a) a^{2}=a^{2}\\left(b^{2}-a^{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nHence\n\n$$\nr^{2}=\\frac{[A B C]^{2}}{s^{2}}=\\frac{a^{2}\\left(b^{2}-a^{2}\\right)}{(b+a)^{2}}\n$$\n\nUsing this we get\n\n$$\n\\frac{a^{4}}{b^{2}-a^{2}}=4\\left(\\frac{a^{2}\\left(b^{2}-a^{2}\\right)}{(b+a)^{2}}\\right)\n$$\n\nTherefore $a^{2}=4(b-a)^{2}$, which gives $a=2(b-a)$ or $2 b=3 a$.

Since in the right triangle $ABC$ the angle $BAC=17^{\\circ}$, the angle $BCA=73^{\\circ}$. Note that triangle $QMC$ is isosceles with base $MC$, as by condition $QM=QC$. Similarly, triangle $PMA$ is isosceles with base $MA$. Therefore, the angles at the bases of these triangles are equal. From this, we get that $\\angle QMP=180^{\\circ}-\\angle PMA-\\angle QMC=180^{\\circ}-17^{\\circ}-73^{\\circ}=90^{\\circ}$.\n\nLet points $O$ and $R$ be the feet of the perpendiculars dropped from points $Q$ and $P$ to the line $AC$, respectively. It is easy to notice that triangles $QOM$ and $MRP$ are similar by two angles. Since $CM=MA$, from the isosceles nature of triangles $QCM$ and $PMA$, it follows that\n\n$$\nMO=\\frac{1}{2} CM=\\frac{1}{2} MA=MR\n$$\n\nLet $x=MO$. From the right triangles $QOM$ and $PMR$, we get that $MQ=\\frac{x}{\\cos 73^{\\circ}}$ and $MP=\\frac{x}{\\cos 17^{\\circ}}$ respectively.

Also, $a_{1}^{2} \\leqslant a_{2}^{2} \\leqslant a_{3}^{2} \\leqslant \\cdots \\leqslant a_{n}^{2}$, so by Chebyshev's inequality, we have\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2} b_{i} \\geqslant \\frac{1}{n}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\\right)\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}\\right)$$\n\nTherefore,\n$$\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} i a_{i}\\right)^{2} \\geqslant \\frac{1}{n}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\\right)\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}\\right)$$\n\nAnd\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}= & \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{2 i k^{2}}{i+k}=\\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^{2}+2 \\sum_{1 \\leqslant i<j \\leqslant n}\\left(\\frac{i^{2} j}{i+j}+\\frac{i j^{2}}{i+j}\\right)= \\\\\n& \\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^{2}+2 i j=\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} i\\right)^{2}=\\frac{n^{2}(n+1)^{2}}{4}\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThus, $\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} i a_{i}\\right)^{2} \\geqslant \\frac{n(n+1)^{2}}{4} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}$.

{"problem":"In a running race, three people started: $X, Y$, and $Z$. $X$ performed the best, $Y$ came in second, while $Z$ lagged a bit behind. During the race, $Z$'s position changed six times, $X$'s position changed five times, and in the end, $Y$ reached the finish line before $X$.\n\nWhat was the final result of the race?","solution":"To ensure the clarity of the task, let's first define the meaning of position and position change in the context of dead heats as follows: only actual overtakes are considered as position changes. That is, if, for example, $X$ is in first place, $Y$ is in second, and $Y$ catches up to $X$, $X$'s position remains first, and $Y$'s remains second. A swap only occurs if $Y$ also passes $X$. In this light, if $X$ catches up to $Y$, and then they both overtake $Z$ simultaneously, the order first becomes $(Z Y X)$, then $(Y Z X)$, and finally $(Y X Z)$. Thus, $Z$'s position changes twice, while the others' change once during this period. In this way, every position change is precisely an event between two competitors; furthermore, there is no dead heat, as among two adjacent competitors, the one who is overtaken is considered to be further ahead.\n\nTurning to the solution of the problem, according to the text, the order immediately after the start was $X Y Z$. If any of their positions changed once, it could only change to an opposite parity. Therefore, with an odd number of position changes, a competitor would end up in a position of opposite parity to their starting position, and with an even number of changes, in a position of the same parity.\n\nSince $X$ was initially in first place and their position changed an odd number of times, they could only have finished in an even-numbered position, i.e., second. According to the last condition, $Y$ overtook $X$, so $Y$ must have been the winner, while $Z$ took third place. The following example shows one possible sequence of position changes:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r}\n\\text { I } X X X Y Y Y Y Y y \\\\\n\\text { II } Y Z Y Y X Y X Y Y \\\\\n\\text { III } Z Y Z Z X Y X Y\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nIt is clear that $X$'s position changed five times, and $Z$'s position changed six times - the latter was not necessary for the conditions (but would have led to a contradiction if $Z$'s position had also changed an odd number of times).\n\nNote. If we did not handle dead heats in the above manner, the solution would not necessarily be unique.\n\n![](https:\/\/cdn.mathpix.com\/cropped\/2024_05_02_3ca9227b5b1a4c36fc54g-1.jpg?height=84&width=1786&top_left_y=1151&top_left_x=164)\nSince $X$'s position, which changed an odd number of times, ended up in a position of the same parity as the starting position, it is not necessarily the case that $X$ finished second in the race.

Solution. a) Factorize 2022 into prime factors: $2022=2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 337$. Each even divisor of this number has the form $2 \\cdot 3^{a} \\cdot 337^{b}$, where the exponents $a, b$ take two values 0 or 1. The number of such ordered pairs $(a, b)$ is $4=2 \\cdot 2$. Therefore, there are exactly 4 even divisors, and thus the factor 2 will enter the product in the fourth power. Similarly, the other prime divisors 3 and 337 will enter the product in the fourth power. Thus, $T(2022)=2^{4} \\cdot 3^{4} \\cdot 337^{4}=(2022)^{4}$. b) Since $p$ is a prime number, and $T(n)$ is a power of the number $p$, then $n$ does not have prime divisors other than $p$.

These triangles can also be degenerate. In each of these triangles, the (non-strict) triangle inequality holds: the distance between the blue and the red point is at most equal to the sum of the distances between the blue and the green and between the red and the green point. We count all these triangle inequalities (one for each triangle that can be formed with a blue, a red, and a green point). We count each distance between a red and a blue point $c$ times (since with a fixed blue and red point, you can still choose $c$ points as the third, green vertex), each distance between a green and a red point $b$ times, and each distance between a blue and a green point $a$ times.

Choose one more red point such that this point, together with the green and blue points, forms an isosceles triangle with two sides of length 2. The sum of the distances between red points and the blue point is now $2 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + 8 = 37$. The sum of the distances between red points and the green point is $2 + 1 + 2 + \\cdots + 7 = 30$. The distance between the blue point and the green point is 1.\nWe conclude that the only solution is $(8, 1, 1)$.","answer":"(8, 1, 1)","problem_type":"Geometry"}

But a 2 b 2 + b 2 c 2 + c 2 a 2 = (a 2 + b 2 + c 2 ) 2 \/2 - (a 4 + b 4 + c 4 )\/2, so the equation becomes: (u - v\/2) (a 4 + b 4 + c 4 ) + v(a 2 + b 2 + c 2 ) 2 \/2 = (2u + v)\/4 (13n) 4 . Using the other equation this gives: (2u - v)(a 4 + b 4 + c 4 )\/2 = (2u - v)\/4 (13n) 4 . So if 2u - v is non-zero we can derive the integer equation: 2(a 4 + b 4 + c 4 ) = (13n) 4 . It is unlikely that this has solutions. Indeed, we can use the standard descent argument. If it has a solution in positive integers, then take the solution with smallest n. The lhs is even, so n must be even. Hence a 4 + b 4 + c 4 = 0 mod 8. But fourth powers are all 0 or 1 mod 8, so a, b, and c must all be even. But that means a\/2, b\/2, c\/2, n\/2 is a solution with smaller n. Contradiction. On the other hand, if 2u - v is zero, then the second equation adds nothing.

Let $X=\\left\\{a_{1}, a_{2}, \\cdots, a_{n}\\right\\}$, and $1=a_{1}<a_{2}<\\cdots<a_{n}=100$. For any $a_{k} (2 \\leq k \\leq n-1)$, there exist $a_{i}, a_{j}$ such that $a_{k}=a_{i}+a_{j}$, where it must be that $a_{i}<a_{k}, a_{j}<a_{k}$, i.e., $a_{i} \\leqslant a_{k-1}, a_{j} \\leqslant a_{k-1}$. Therefore, $a_{k}=a_{i}+a_{j} \\leqslant a_{k-1}+a_{k-1}=2 a_{k-1}$.

It is easy to see that $a_{2}=2=2^{2-1}$, otherwise $a_{2}$ cannot be expressed as the sum of two numbers in $X$.

Since $a_{t}$ can be expressed as the sum of two numbers in $X$, there exist $a_{i}, a_{j} (i, j < t)$ such that $a_{t}=a_{i}+a_{j}$. If $a_{i}=a_{j}$, then $a_{t}=2 a_{i}=2 \\times 2^{i-1}=2^{i}$.
