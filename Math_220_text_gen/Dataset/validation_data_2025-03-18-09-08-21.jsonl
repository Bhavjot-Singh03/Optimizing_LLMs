By the time the ant has reached $C$, it has travelled $9+18+3 \\times 36$ or $135 \\mathrm{~cm}$ along the length of the rectangle. To travel from $C$ to $X$, the ant must travel $15 \\mathrm{~cm}$ along the length of the rectangle which puts the ant $3 \\mathrm{~cm}$ from the closest vertex.\n\n![](https:\/\/cdn.mathpix.com\/cropped\/2024_04_20_688a3b42f69739f2e244g-262.jpg?height=355&width=1764&top_left_y=240&top_left_x=175)\n\nANSWER: (A)<|im_end|>\n"}

He noticed that his fingers leave  that reveal which digits were pressed. He decided to change his access code to provide the largest number of possible combinations for a burglar to try when the digits are known. For each number of distinct digits that could be used in the access code, calculate the number of possible combinations when the digits are known but their order and frequency are not known. For example, if there are smudges on $3$ and $9,$ two possible codes are $393939$ and $993999.$ Which number of distinct digits in the access code offers the most combinations?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Combinatorics, Solution:1. Define \\( f(x) \\) as the number of possible combinations for the access code given that it has \\( x \\) distinct digits, for all integers \\( 1 \\leq x \\leq 6 \\). Clearly, \\( f(1) = 1 \\).\n\n2. We claim that \\( f(n) = n^6 - \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n}{i} f(i) \\right) \\) for all integers \\( 2 \\leq n \\leq 6 \\).\n\n3. To prove this, note that the number of ways to have a 6-digit access code using a given set of \\( n \\) digits is \\( n^6 \\) if not all of the digits must be used. We now proceed with complementary counting.\n\n4. Since \\( n \\) is an integer \\( 2 \\leq n \\leq 6 \\), this means that \\( n^6 \\) equals the sum of the number of ways to have a 6-digit access code using \\( a \\) of the digits in the set of \\( n \\) digits, where \\( a \\) is any arbitrary positive integer less than or equal to \\( n \\).\n\n5. When \\( a = n \\), we can only choose one set with \\( a \\) elements that is a subset of our original set of \\( n \\) digits, so the number of 6-digit access codes formable using all \\( n \\) of the digits in the set of \\( n \\) digits is \\( f(n) \\).\n\n6. Thus, \\( f(n) \\) is \\( n^6 \\) minus the number of 6-digit access codes that can be formed by only using a proper subset of the original set of \\( n \\) digits.\n\n7. Therefore, \\( f(n) \\) is equal to \\( n^6 \\) minus the number of six-digit access codes that can be formed by only using exactly \\( b \\) of the digits in the original set, where \\( b \\) ranges from the integers from 1 to \\( n-1 \\).\n\n8. For any particular value of \\( b \\), there are \\( \\binom{n}{b} \\) subsets of the set of \\( n \\) digits with \\( b \\) digits. Also, for any subset \\( C \\) of the set of \\( n \\) digits with \\( b \\) elements, the number of ways to form a 6-digit access code using all of the elements in \\( C \\) is \\( f(b) \\), so the number of ways to form a 6-digit access code using exactly \\( b \\) digits from the subset of the \\( n \\) digits is \\( \\binom{n}{b} f(b) \\) for all integers \\( 1 \\leq b \\leq n-1 \\).\n\n9. A 6-digit access code cannot be formed without using any digits, so the number of ways to form a 6-digit access code by only using digits from a proper subset of the set of \\( n \\) digits is \\( \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n}{i} f(i) \\).\n\n10. Thus, \\( f(n) = n^6 - \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n}{i} f(i) \\right) \\) for all integers \\( 2 \\leq n \\leq 6 \\).\n\n11. Now, we can calculate \\( f(i) \\) for all integers \\( 2 \\leq i \\leq 6 \\).\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nf(2) &= 2^6 - \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{1} \\binom{2}{i} f(i) \\right) = 64 - 2 = 62, \\\\\nf(3) &= 3^6 - \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{2} \\binom{3}{i} f(i) \\right) = 729 - 3 \\cdot 62 - 3 \\cdot 1 = 729 - 189 = 540, \\\\\nf(4) &= 4^6 - \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\binom{4}{i} f(i) \\right) = 4096 - 4 \\cdot 540 - 6 \\cdot 62 - 4 \\cdot 1 = 4096 - 2536 = 1560, \\\\\nf(5) &= 5^6 - \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\binom{5}{i} f(i) \\right) = 15625 - 5 \\cdot 1560 - 10 \\cdot 540 - 10 \\cdot 62 - 5 \\cdot 1 = 15625 - 13825 = 1800, \\\\\nf(6) &= 6^6 - \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{5} \\binom{6}{i} f(i) \\right) = 46656 - 6 \\cdot 1800 - 15 \\cdot 1560 - 20 \\cdot 540 - 15 \\cdot 62 - 6 \\cdot 1 = 46656 - 45936 = 720.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n12. Therefore, \\( f(1) = 1 \\), \\( f(2) = 62 \\), \\( f(3) = 540 \\), \\( f(4) = 1560 \\), \\( f(5) = 1800 \\), and \\( f(6) = 720 \\).\n\n13.

We use vectors center G. Take GA = A , GB = B , GC = C . Then GM = A \/2 + B \/2 and GX = 3\/4 A + 1\/4 C . Hence GA' = 2\/5 A (showing it lies on GA) = 4\/5 (3\/4 A + 1\/4 B ) + 1\/5 C , since A + B + C = 0 (which shows it lies on CX). Similarly, GB'' = 4\/7 (1\/2 A + 1\/2 C ) (showing it lies on the median through B) = 2\/7 A + 2\/7 C = 5\/7 (2\/5 A ) + 2\/7 C (showing it lies on CA' and hence on CX). Hence GB'' = -2\/7 B . So we have shown that GB'' is parallel to GB' and 5\/7 the length. The same applies to the distances from the centroid to the other vertices.

Determine the remainders of the number $2^{1000}$ when divided by 3, 5, 11, and 13.\n\nSubtraction in $m$-arithmetic, like ordinary arithmetic, is defined as the inverse operation of addition: a number $x$ is called the difference of numbers $b$ and $a (x=b-a)$ if\n\n$$\na+x=b\n$$\n\nFor example, in 7-arithmetic,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& 2-5=4, \\text { because } 5+4=2 \\\\\n& 1-6=2, \\text { because } 6+2=1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe fastest way to compute the difference of two numbers in $m$-arithmetic is to find the difference in the usual sense and, if it is negative, increase it by $m$. For example, in 7-arithmetic,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& 1-5=-4=3 \\\\\n& 2-3=-1=6\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSubtraction in $m$-arithmetic is always possible and leads to a unique answer. The use of the usual minus sign \"\u4e00\" for the $m$-arithmetic operation of subtraction is justified by the fact that if a formula from ordinary algebra is true and contains only the signs \"+\", \"\u2212\", \"\u00b7\" and any number of parentheses, then such a formula remains true when interpreted in $m$-arithmetic. In particular, the formulas\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left.-(-a)=a^{1}\\right) \\\\\n& -(a+b)=-a-b \\\\\n& -(a-b)=-a+b \\\\\n& a-1(-b)=a-b\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n1) $-a$, as usual, denotes the number $0-a$. For example, in 8-arithmetic, $-3=5$.\nas well as the formulas\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\na^{2}-b^{2} & =(a-b)(a+b) \\\\\n(a-b)^{2} & =a^{2}-2 a b+b^{2} \\\\\n(a-b)^{3} & =a^{3}-3 a^{2} b+3 a b^{2}-b^{3}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand others.\n\n$m$-arithmetic is applied to ordinary arithmetic to check operations of addition, subtraction, and multiplication. For this, the fact is used that a true equality from ordinary arithmetic turns into a true equality in $m$-arithmetic if each number is replaced by its remainder when divided by $m$. Let's check, for example, using 7-arithmetic the equality\n\n$$\n74218 \\cdot 21363-81835=1585446299\n$$\n\nReplacing each number by its remainder when divided by 7, we get:\n\n$$\n4 \\cdot 6-5=1\n$$\n\nThis equality is not true in 7-arithmetic and, therefore, the original example contains an error. Most often, 9-arithmetic is used for checking. The reason is that any number $N$ and the sum of its digits give the same remainder when divided by 9, which greatly simplifies finding the remainders when divided by $9^{1}$ ).\n\nNote that checking using $m$-arithmetic does not always allow the detection of errors. For example, if we were to check the incorrect equality (1) using 9-arithmetic, we would arrive at the correct 9-arithmetic equality\n\n$$\n4 \\cdot 6-7=8\n$$\n\nTo make the omission of an error less likely, one can perform the check simultaneously using several different $m$-arithmetics, for example, using 7-arithmetic and 9-arithmetic.\n\n1) The numbers $10,10^{2}, 10^{3}, \\ldots$ give a remainder of 1 when divided by 9. Therefore, the numbers\n\n$$\nN=a \\cdot 10^{n}+b \\cdot 10^{n-1}+\\ldots+f \\text { and } a+b+\\ldots+f\n$$\n\ngive the same remainder when divided by 9.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Number Theory, Solution:64.

In our case, these two symmetries are equivalent to a $90^{\\circ}$ rotation around point $A$.\n\n![](https:\/\/cdn.mathpix.com\/cropped\/2024_05_06_821ca558098873554acag-1.jpg?height=468&width=446&top_left_y=2207&top_left_x=1481)\n\n## Interregional School Olympiad in Mathematics for Students of Departmental Educational Organizations\n\nThis means that the image of point $D$ under symmetry relative to $A F$ and the image of point $B$ under symmetry relative to $A E$ are the same point; on the diagram, it is denoted as $K$. From point $K$, segments $A E$ and $A F$ are seen at a $90^{\\circ}$ angle (angles are preserved under symmetry, so, for example, angles $A B E$ and $A K E$ are equal). Therefore, point $K$ is the foot of the perpendicular dropped from point $A$ to line $E F$.\n\nFinally, since $B E = E K$ and $D F = F K$ (lengths of segments are preserved under symmetry), we see that the perimeter of triangle $C E F$ is equal to the sum of the lengths of sides $B C$ and $C D$ of the square.\n\nAnswer: 2.<|im_end|>\n"}

Distribute three times two packs, 3 * 1 = 3 cookies will remain. But the same six packs of cookies can be distributed differently - three and another three, and then 2 * 13 = 26 cookies will remain. Therefore, 26 - 3 = 23 cookies can be divided equally among the tourists. Since the number 23 is prime, this is only possible if there are 23 tourists.\n\nSecond solution. First, divide two packs of cookies. One extra cookie remains. Divide the third pack. It contains 13 - 1 = 12 extra cookies. But then there should have been 12 * 2 = 24 extra cookies in the two packs. Why is there actually only one? Because 24 - 1 = 23 cookies the tourists were able to divide equally. Since the number 23 is prime, this is only possible if there are 23 tourists.\n\nComment. The number of cookies in a pack cannot be determined from the problem statement. There could have been 12, 35, 58, etc.<|im_end|>\n"}

What is the 3-dimensional volume of S? What is the 4-dimensional volume of its interior? Solution<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Calculus, Solution:: 2\u03c0 2 r 3 , 1\/2 \u03c0 2 r 4 . A hyperplane perpendicular to the x-axis will cut S in a sphere. If the hyperplane is at a distance k from the origin, then the radius of the sphere will be \u221a(r 2 - k 2 ). So the 4-dimensional volume = \u222b -r r 4\u03c0\/3 (r 2 - x 2 ) 3\/2 dx = 4\u03c0 r 4 \/3 \u222b -1 1 (1 - t 2 ) 3\/2 dt. Let K = (1 - t 2 ) 3\/2 dt.

C = sin -1 t differentiates to (1 - t 2 ) -1\/2 . Hence B + C differentiates to 2(1 - t 2 ) 1\/2 , so 2A + 3(B + C) differentiates to 8K. So \u222b -1 1 (1 - t 2 ) 3\/2 dt = ( terms involving powers of (1 - t 2 ) 1\/2 + 3\/8 sin -1 t )| -1 1 = 3 \u03c0 \/8. Hence the 4-dimensional volume is \u03c0 2 r 4 \/2. The volume of the 3-dimensional surface is the derivative wrt r of the 4-dimensional volume (because the 4-dimensional volume for r + \u03b4r is the 4-dimensional volume for r + the 3-dimensional volume of the bounding sphere times \u03b4r). Hence the 3-dimensional volume is 2 \u03c0 2 r 3 . 11th Putnam 1951 \u00a9 John Scholes jscholes@kalva.demon.co.uk 5 Mar 2002<|im_end|>\n"}

Ruth leaves the room; in the meantime, one of the other children hides a ring on themselves. Ruth returns and must determine who has the ring. Each child then makes three statements. Of these statements, two are true and one is false. Ruth must determine who has the ring based on these statements without guessing.\n\nEwald: 1. I do not have the ring.\n\n2. Fritz has the ring.\n3. I have played this game many times before.\n\nFritz: 1. I do not have the ring.\n\n2. Ewald is wrong if he thinks I have the ring.\n3. Erika has the ring.\n\nNow Ruth interrupts and says, \"I need to think, maybe I can already figure out who has the ring.\" And after a few minutes, Ruth says who has the ring. How could she have figured it out?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Logic and Puzzles, Solution:The idea is to find out which statements of Ewald and Fritz contradict each other, as then one of them must be false.\n\nSince Fritz's statements 1 and 2 are equivalent, they can only be true or false at the same time. The latter is excluded, as Fritz only makes one false statement. Therefore, his 3rd statement is false; neither he nor Erika have the ring.\n\nEwald's 2nd statement contradicts Fritz's first (which is true), so it is false.\n\nThus, Ewald's 1st statement must be true, leaving only Brigitte. Therefore, she has the ring.<|im_end|>\n"}

Furthermore, since $A$ is a square, it has a side length of 100. Consequently, the shorter side of rectangle $B$ is $136-100=36$ and its longer side is 100, as indicated in the following figure:\n\n![](https:\/\/cdn.mathpix.com\/cropped\/2024_05_01_20684006194a352111ccg-21.jpg?height=371&width=906&top_left_y=2182&top_left_x=675)\n\nOne of the sides of rectangle $C$ is 100 and the other is half the shorter side of rectangle $B$, which is $\\frac{36}{2}=18$.

From the condition, it follows that the desired number cannot consist of three or fewer digits. We will look for the smallest such number in the form $\\overline{a b c d}$, where $a, b, c, d$ are digits, and $a \\neq 0$. We will form the equation:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\overline{a b c d}=a+b+c+d+1755 \\Leftrightarrow 1000 a+100 b+10 c+d=a+b+c+d+1755 \\Leftrightarrow \\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow 999 a+99 b+9 c=1755 \\Leftrightarrow 111 a+11 b+c=195\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nFrom the last equation, we conclude that the only possible value for the digit $a$ is 1. Next, we get the equation $11 b+c=84$, which means the digit $b$ can only be 7. Finally, we need to find the value of $c=84-11 \\cdot 7=7$.

We understand an axis of the polyhedron to be a line that is the axis of symmetry for every cross-sectional domain of a plane intersecting the said line.\n\nThe edges of our polyhedron are grouped as follows: 1) the base edges of the pyramids, which, after combination, form a $2n$-sided regular polygon with center $O$ in a single plane, consisting of $2n$ edges; 2) $n$ planes intersect the axis, each containing 4 pyramid edges, forming a kite that is symmetrical to the axis. The equal sides of the kites are the side edges of the combined pyramids (opposite to each other).\n\nEach edge of our polyhedron lies in one of the mentioned $n+1$ planes, but only in one. A cutting plane intersects each of these planes in a straight line, thus intersecting the perimeter of each polygon at most at 2 points. Therefore, the number of intersection points formed by the edges of the polyhedron is at most $2(n+1)$, meaning the resulting plane section can be a polygon with at most $2(n+1)$ vertices and sides.\n\nSuch a polygon with this many sides can indeed be obtained, for example, by intersecting the body with a plane that passes through two points on the perimeter of the $2n$-sided polygon, opposite to each other and not coinciding with the vertices, and does not contain the axis. This plane passes through the intersection points of the diagonals of the kites, thus intersecting their perimeters at 2 points each. These points are all distinct, as the plane does not pass through any vertex.\n\nBenk\u00f6 B\u00e1lint (S\u00e1rospatak, R\u00e1k\u00f3czi g. III, o. t.)<|im_end|>\n"}

If we temporarily allow digits larger than 9, then 4n = (4a 1 )(4a 2 )...(4a k ). Each carry of one reduces the digit sum by 9, so after making all necessary carries, the digit sum for 4n is at most 4s. It can only be 4s iff there are no carries. Similarly, 11n has digit sum at most 2s, with equality iff there are no carries. Since 44n has digit sum 8s, there cannot be any carries. In particular, there are no carries in forming 4n, so each digit of n is at most 2. Hence there are no carries in forming 3n and the digit sum of 3n is 300.

Trying to console him, Fidel notes that, given that sum, the product of the numbers was as large as possible. How many $2$s did Hugo roll?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Number Theory, Solution:1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   Hugo rolls 25 twenty-sided dice, and the sum of the numbers rolled is 70. We need to determine how many 2's Hugo rolled if the product of the numbers is maximized.\n\n2. **Formulating the Problem:**\n   Let \\( x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_{25} \\) be the numbers rolled on the 25 dice. We know:\n   \\[\n   x_1 + x_2 + \\cdots + x_{25} = 70\n   \\]\n   We need to maximize the product:\n   \\[\n   P = x_1 \\cdot x_2 \\cdot \\cdots \\cdot x_{25}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Using the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean Inequality (AM-GM Inequality):**\n   The AM-GM Inequality states that for non-negative real numbers \\( a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_n}{n} \\geq \\sqrt[n]{a_1 \\cdot a_2 \\cdot \\cdots \\cdot a_n}\n   \\]\n   Equality holds if and only if \\( a_1 = a_2 = \\cdots = a_n \\).\n\n4. **Applying AM-GM Inequality:**\n   For our problem, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \\cdots + x_{25}}{25} = \\frac{70}{25} = 2.8\n   \\]\n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt[25]{x_1 \\cdot x_2 \\cdot \\cdots \\cdot x_{25}} \\leq 2.8\n   \\]\n   To maximize the product \\( P \\), the numbers \\( x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_{25} \\) should be as close to 2.8 as possible.\n\n5. **Finding the Closest Integers:**\n   The closest integers to 2.8 are 2 and 3. We need to find a combination of 2's and 3's that sum to 70.\n\n6. **Setting Up the Equation:**\n   Let \\( a \\) be the number of 2's and \\( b \\) be the number of 3's. We have:\n   \\[\n   a + b = 25\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2a + 3b = 70\n   \\]\n\n7. **Solving the System of Equations:**\n   From the first equation:\n   \\[\n   b = 25 - a\n   \\]\n   Substitute into the second equation:\n   \\[\n   2a + 3(25 - a) = 70\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2a + 75 - 3a = 70\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   -a + 75 = 70\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   -a = -5\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   a = 5\n   \\]\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   Hugo rolled 5 twos and the remaining \\( 25 - 5 = 20 \\) threes.\n\nThe final answer is \\( \\boxed{5} \\).<|im_end|>\n"}

The river is straight, and the rafts move at the speed of the current, which is the same everywhere and is expressed as an integer number of km\/h, not less than 6. What is the greatest possible value of this speed?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Algebra, Solution:Let the habitat of the Mumbo-Jumbo tribe be denoted by $O$, the storage that Mumbo ran to by $M$, and the storage that Jumbo went to by $U$. Clearly, $M$ is located upstream from $O$, while $U$ is downstream. Let the distances from $O$ to $M$ and $U$ be $x$ and $y$ km, respectively $(x < y)$, and the speed of the river be $v$ km\/h. The time it took Jumbo to travel from $O$ to $U$ was $y \/ 6$ hours, and Mumbo took $x \/ 11 + (x + y) \/ v$ hours. Since Jumbo arrived at $U$ before Mumbo, we have $y \/ 6 < x \/ 11 + (x + y) \/ v < y \/ 11 + 2y \/ v$. Dividing by $y$ and transforming, we get $v < 26.4$.\n\nIt remains to check whether the speed of the river could have been 26 km\/h. For this, in the inequality $y \/ 6 < x \/ 11 + (x + y) \/ v$, let $v = 26$ and transform it equivalently to the form $y' < 111 \/ 110$. The latter is possible (for example, when $y = 1.12$ km, $x = 1.11$ km).\n[ Arithmetic operations. Numerical identities ]\nProblem<|im_end|>\n"}

Roma thought of a natural number, the sum of the digits of which is divisible by 8. Then he added 2 to the thought number and again got a number, the sum of the digits of which is divisible by 8. Find the smallest number that Roma could have thought of.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Number Theory, Solution:Answer: 699.\n\nSolution. If both numbers are divisible by 8, then their difference is also divisible by 8. If there was no carry-over when adding, the sum of the digits would differ by 2, which is not divisible by 8. If there was a carry-over but not into the hundreds place, the sum of the digits would differ by $9-2=7$, which is also not divisible by 8. If there was a carry-over into the hundreds place but not into the thousands place, the sum of the digits would change by $2 \\cdot 9-2=16$, which is divisible by 8.\n\nFor a carry-over into the hundreds place when adding two, the last two digits must be 98 or 99. Now, let's find the smallest number in each case with a sum of digits divisible by 8. These numbers are 798 and 699; it is clear that 699 is smaller (and it obviously meets the condition).\n\nIt remains to note that if there was a carry-over into the thousands place or higher when adding 2, the original number would be at least 998, but the found number is already smaller.<|im_end|>\n"}

Since $x^{2}+2 x+10=(x+1)^{2}+9>0$ for any value of $x$, the given inequality is defined for any real value of $x$. Let's investigate some properties of the continuous function\n\n$$\nf(x)=\\sqrt[4]{(x+1)^{2}+9}+x^{4}+32 x-62\n$$\n\nIf $x \\geqslant 0$, then the continuous function $f(x)$ is increasing. Therefore, the equation $f(x)=0$ has no more than one non-negative root $x_{1}$. But $f(0)0$, so $00$ is true for any value of $x$. Therefore, the equation $f(x)=0$ does not have roots for those values of $x$ that are solutions of the inequality $x^{4}+32 x-62 \\geqslant 0$.\n\nWe get $x^{4}+32 x-62=x\\left(x^{3}+32\\right)-62$. If $x \\leqslant-4$, then $x^{3}+32128$. Therefore, for $x \\leqslant-4$, the inequality $x^{4}+32 x-62>0$ holds. Now it is clear that the negative roots of the equation $f(x)=0$ can only belong to the interval $(-4 ; 0)$.\n\nUsing a programmable microcalculator, we construct a table of values of the function $f(x)$:\n\n| $x$ | -4 | $-3.5$ | -3 | $-2.5$ | -2 | $-1.5$ | -1 | $-0.5$ | 0 |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $f(x)$ | 68 | -22 | -75 | -101 | -108 | -103 | -91 | -76 | -60 |\n\nBased on this table, we can assume that the equation $f(x)=0$ has no roots on the interval $[-3.5 ; 0]$. But how do we prove this?\n\nObviously,\n\n$$\n\\sqrt[4]{9} \\leqslant \\sqrt[4]{(x+1)^{2}+9} \\leqslant \\sqrt[4]{(-3.5+1)^{2}+9}\n$$\n\nHence,\n\n$$\n1.73 \\leqslant \\sqrt[4]{(x+1)^{2}+9} \\leqslant 1.98\n$$\n\nLet's determine how the function $\\varphi(x)=x^{4}+$ $+32 x-62$ changes on the interval $[-3.5 ; 0]$. We find $\\varphi^{\\prime}(x)=$\n$=4 x^{3}+32$. Solving the equation $4 x^{3}+32=0$, we get $x=-2$. We calculate:\n\n$\\varphi(-2)=-110 ; \\varphi(0)=-62 ; \\varphi(-3.5) \\approx-23.9375$. (4)\n\nFrom conditions (3) and (4), it is clear that on the entire interval $[-3.5 ; 0]$, the function $f(x)0$, and $f(-3.5) \\approx-22<0$, so there exists a unique root $x_{2}$ of the equation $f(x)=0$ on the interval $(-4 ;-3.5)$.\n\nTo refine the values of the roots $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$, we construct a table of values of the function $f(x)$ using a microcalculator:\n\n| $x$ | $f(x)$ | $x$ | $f(x)$ |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n|  |  |  |  |\n| 0 | $-60.22$ | -4 | 68.06 |\n| 2 | 20.06 | -3 | $-75.1$ |\n| 1.5 | $-7.00$ | $-3.5$ | $-21.96$ |\n| 1.6 | $-2.25$ | $-3.7$ | 9.02 |\n| 1.7 | 2.76 | $-3.65$ | 0.6897 |\n| 1.65 | 0.9754 | -35 | $-0.92905$ |\n| 1.64 | $-0.287$ | $-3.645$ | $-0.12166$ |\n| 1.643 | $-0.13743$ | $-3.646$ | 0.04029 |\n| 1.644 | $-0.087508$ |  |  |\n| 1.645 | $-0.037553$ |  |  |\n| 1.646 | 0.012434 |  |  |\n\nThus, $x_{1} \\approx-3.6455 ; x_{2} \\approx 1.6455$.\n\nIt is easy to notice that $x_{1}+x_{1} \\approx-2, x_{1} x_{2} \\approx-6$. Solving the system of equations: $x_{1}+x_{2}=-2, x_{1} x_{2}=-6$, we get the hypothesis:\n\n$$\nx_{1}=-\\sqrt{7}-1, x_{2}=\\sqrt{7}-1\n$$\n\nBy direct substitution of $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ into the equation $f(x)=0$, we confirm the validity of this hypothesis.<|im_end|>\n"}

We claim that $I$ is the circumcenter of $D E F$.\nTo prove this, let the incircle touch $A B, B C$, and $A C$ at $X, Y$, and $Z$, respectively. Noting that $X B=B Y=2, Y C=C Z=4$, and $Z A=A X=3$, we see that $X D=Y E=Z F=9$. Thus, since $I X=I Y=I Z=r$ (where $r$ is the inradius) and $\\angle I X D=\\angle I Y E=\\angle I Z F=90^{\\circ}$, we have three congruent right triangles, and so $I D=I E=I F$, as desired.\nLet $s=\\frac{5+6+7}{2}=9$ be the semiperimeter. By Heron's formula, $[A B C]=\\sqrt{9(9-5)(9-6)(9-7)}=$ $6 \\sqrt{6}$, so $r=\\frac{[A B C]}{s}=\\frac{2 \\sqrt{6}}{3}$.

Noting that $D A=E^{\\prime} A$ and $A F=A F^{\\prime}$, we see that $D E^{\\prime} F^{\\prime} F$ is cyclic by power of a point. Similarly, $E F^{\\prime} D^{\\prime} D$ and $F D^{\\prime} E^{\\prime} E$ are cyclic. Now, note that the radical axes for the three circles circumscribing these quadrilaterals are the sides of $A B C$, which are not concurrent. Therefore, $D D^{\\prime} F F^{\\prime} E E^{\\prime}$ is cyclic. We can deduce that the circumcenter of this circle is $I$ in two ways: either by calculating that the midpoint of $D^{\\prime} E$ coincides with the foot from $I$ to $B C$, or by noticing that the perpendicular bisector of $F F^{\\prime}$ is $A I$. The area can then be calculated the same way as the previous solution.<|im_end|>\n"}

The cards are of three kinds: with both sides white, both sides black, or with a white and a black side. Initially, nine of the twelve cards have a black side up. The cards 1-6 are turned, and subsequently four of the twelve cards have a black side up. Now cards 4-9 are turned, and six cards have a black side up. Finally, the cards 1-3 and 10-12 are turned, after which five cards have a black side up. How many cards of each kind are there?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Logic and Puzzles, Solution:Answer: there are 9 cards with one black and one white side and 3 cards with both sides white.\n\nDivide the cards into four types according to the table below.\n\n| Type | Initially up | Initially down |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $A$ | black | white |\n| $B$ | white | black |\n| $C$ | white | white |\n| $D$ | black | black |\n\nWhen the cards 1-6 were turned, the number of cards with a black side up decreased by 5. Hence among the cards 1-6 there are five of type $A$ and one of type $C$ or $D$. The result of all three moves is that cards $7-12$ have been turned over, hence among these cards there must be four of type $A$, and the combination of the other two must be one of the following:\n\n(a) one of type $A$ and one of type $B$;\n\n(b) one of type $C$ and one of type $D$;\n\n(c) both of type $C$;\n\n(d) both of type $D$.\n\nHence the unknown card among the cards 1-6 cannot be of type $D$, since this would make too many cards having a black side up initially. For the same reason, the alternatives (a), (b) and (d) are impossible. Hence there were nine cards of type $A$ and three cards of type $C$.\n\nAlternative solution. Denote by $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{12}$ the sides of each card that are initially visible, and by $b_{1}, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{12}$ the initially invisible sides each of these is either white or black. The conditions of the problem imply the following:\n\n(a) there are 9 black and 3 white sides among $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4}, a_{5}, a_{6}$, $a_{7}, a_{8}, a_{9}, a_{10}, a_{11}, a_{12}$\n\n(b) there are 4 black and 8 white sides among $b_{1}, b_{2}, b_{3}, b_{4}, b_{5}, b_{6}, a_{7}$, $a_{8}, a_{9}, a_{10}, a_{11}, a_{12}$;\n(c) there are 6 black and 6 white sides among $b_{1}, b_{2}, b_{3}, a_{4}, a_{5}, a_{6}, b_{7}$, $b_{8}, b_{9}, a_{10}, a_{11}, a_{12}$;\n\n(d) there are 5 black and 7 white sides among $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4}, a_{5}, a_{6}, b_{7}$, $b_{8}, b_{9}, b_{10}, b_{11}, b_{12}$.\n\nCases (b) and (d) together enumerate each of the sides $a_{i}$ and $b_{i}$ exactly once - hence there are 9 black and 15 white sides altogether. Therefore, all existing black sides are enumerated in (a), implying that we have 9 cards with one black and one white side, and the remaining 3 cards have both sides white.<|im_end|>\n"}

(5 points)\n\nIn an $8 \\times 8$ table, some 23 cells are black, and the rest are white. In each white cell, the sum of the number of black cells on the same row and the number of black cells on the same column is written; nothing is written in the black cells. What is the maximum value that the sum of the numbers in the entire table can take?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Combinatorics, Solution:Answer: 234\n\n## Solution:\n\nThe number in the white cell consists of two addends: \"horizontal\" and \"vertical\". Consider the sum of all \"horizontal\" addends and the sum of all \"vertical\" addends separately across the entire table. If we maximize each of these two sums separately, the total sum will also be the largest.\n\nConsider the sum of the \"horizontal\" addends. If a row contains $x_{i}$ black cells and $8-x_{i}$ white cells, then the sum of the horizontal addends in this row is $x_{i}(8-x_{i})$. Summing this sum over all rows, we get $8(x_{1}+\\ldots+x_{8})-x_{1}^{2}-\\ldots-x_{8}^{2}=8 \\cdot 23-(x_{1}^{2}+\\ldots+x_{8}^{2})$. We need to maximize this expression, i.e., minimize the sum of the squares of eight numbers whose sum is 23. As is known, the sum of the squares of numbers decreases as these numbers approach their arithmetic mean, so for integers, the minimum is achieved when seven of the eight numbers are 3, and the remaining one is 2.\n\nThus, we get that the smallest possible sum of \"horizontal\" addends is $8 \\cdot 23-7 \\cdot 3^{2}-2^{2}=117$. A similar estimate can be obtained for the sum of \"vertical\" addends, which gives us a final value of 234.\n\nIt remains to ensure that there is a coloring of the table in which both sums are maximal simultaneously, i.e., in which each column or row contains 2 or 3 shaded cells.\n\n![](https:\/\/cdn.mathpix.com\/cropped\/2024_05_06_21e870cb932e699b067eg-4.jpg?height=434&width=552&top_left_y=2213&top_left_x=752)<|im_end|>\n"}

Find the angle at vertex $C$.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Geometry, Solution:Solution. Let $C C_{1}$ be the height dropped from vertex $C$ and let $A A_{1}$ be the angle bisector of angle $\\alpha$ at vertex $A$ (see diagram). Since triangle $A B C$ is isosceles, point $C_{1}$ is the midpoint of side $A B$ and $C C_{1}$ is the angle bisector of angle $\\gamma$ at vertex $C$. Let $C_{2}$ be a point on line $C C_{1}$ such that $\\overline{C C_{1}}=\\overline{C_{1} C_{2}}$ (see diagram). From the fact that the diagonals of quadrilateral $A C_{2} B C$ bisect each other, it follows that this quadrilateral is a parallelogram. Since $A C_{2} \\| C A_{1}$ and $\\overline{A A_{1}}=\\overline{C C_{2}}$, quadrilateral $A C_{2} A_{1} C$ is an isosceles trapezoid, from which it follows that $\\frac{\\gamma}{2}=\\measuredangle C_{2} C A_{1}=\\measuredangle C A_{1} A$. From triangles $A C_{1} C$ and $A A_{1} C$, we get $\\gamma=90^{\\circ}-\\frac{\\gamma}{2}$ and $\\frac{\\gamma}{2}=180^{\\circ}-\\gamma-\\frac{\\gamma}{2}$ respectively.

Their squares are 16, 36, 64, 81, respectively. Breaking these down into the product of a one-digit and a two-digit number, and considering that $a<c$ is necessary, only $1 \\cdot 16$ fits the desired form of $a \\cdot \\overline{a c}$. Thus, $b^{2}=16$, or $b=4, a=1, c=6$.\n\nIndeed, $1,4,16,64$ meet the requirements of the problem.\n\nII. solution.

(50 points) There are 26 stamp collectors from different countries who want to exchange the latest commemorative stamps issued by their respective countries through correspondence.

Solution: Using the principle of counting twice and the principle of abstraction. Without loss of generality, let one of the 26 stamp collectors be the leader. On one hand, for the leader to receive the latest commemorative stamps from the other 25 countries, these must be sent by the other 25 collectors (regardless of whether they send directly to the leader), which requires at least 25 letters; similarly, the other 25 collectors each need to receive a set of the latest commemorative stamps from the leader, which must be sent by the leader (regardless of whether he sends directly to the collectors), requiring at least 25 letters, totaling at least 50 letters. On the other hand, the other 25 collectors each send 25 sets of the latest commemorative stamps from their own country to the leader, totaling 25 letters. After the leader receives these 25 letters, he then sends one letter to each of the 25 collectors, each containing 25 sets of stamps (excluding the set from the collector's own country) or 26 sets of stamps (including the set from the collector's own country), totaling 25 letters, making a total of 50 letters. This means that 50 letters can ensure that each of the 26 collectors has a set of the latest commemorative stamps from 26 countries. Therefore, at least 50 letters need to be sent.<|im_end|>\n"}

Let $M, N, K$ be the points of tangency of the inscribed circle with the sides $AB, CD, AD$ respectively; let $I$ be the center of the inscribed circle. Denote the radius of the circle by $r$. Immediately note that $BM = BL = 4$ (the first equality follows from the equality of tangent segments), from which $AK = AM = AB - BM = 2$ (the first equality follows from the equality of tangent segments, the second is obvious).\n\n![](https:\/\/cdn.mathpix.com\/cropped\/2024_05_06_08868d1266709e60d590g-14.jpg?height=372&width=985&top_left_y=1750&top_left_x=541)\n\nSince $I$ is the point of intersection of the angle bisectors of the internal angles of the trapezoid, then $\\angle IAD + \\angle IDA = (\\angle DAB + \\angle ADC) \/ 2 = 180^\\circ \/ 2 = 90^\\circ$, where the penultimate equality follows from the parallelism of lines $AB$ and $CD$. Therefore, triangle $AID$ is a right triangle and $\\angle AID = 90^\\circ$. Similarly, triangle $BIC$ is also a right triangle.\n\nNext, since $IK$ and $IL$ are radii drawn to the points of tangency, then $\\angle IKD = 90^\\circ$ and $\\angle ILB = 90^\\circ$. Therefore, $IK$ and $IL$ are altitudes in triangles $AID$ and $BIC$ respectively.

It is sufficient to prove that it has a height less than 1. The equivalent condition is: the triangle has a side $a > 2S$. Suppose all sides of the triangle do not exceed $2S$. Let $\\gamma$ be the smallest angle of the triangle. Then $S = \\frac{1}{2} a b \\sin \\gamma \\leq \\frac{a b \\sqrt{3}}{4} \\leq \\sqrt{3} S^2$, so $S \\geq 1 \/ \\sqrt{3}$. This leads to a contradiction.\n\nNow consider an isosceles triangle with height 1 and base $a \\geq 2 \/ \\sqrt{3}$. The lateral sides have a length not greater than the length of the base, so the considered triangle has no height less than 1. We will prove that in this case, the triangle cannot be cut out from a strip of width less than 1. Suppose the triangle $ABC$ is located inside a strip of width less than 1. Draw lines through its vertices perpendicular to the sides of the strip. Let's assume for definiteness that the line passing through vertex $B$ is between the other two lines. Then it intersects side $AC$ at some point $M$. On the one hand, $BM < 1$. On the other hand, $BM \\geq h_{\\mathrm{b}}$, so $h_{\\mathrm{b}} < 1$.\n\n## Answer\n\nThe area can be equal to any positive number not less than $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$.<|im_end|>\n"}

At the vertices of a square with a side length of 4, there are four cities. These cities need to be connected by roads such that it is possible to travel from any city to any other. Propose at least one variant of such roads with a total length of less than 11.\n\nHint. The following statement may be useful in solving the problem (which can be used without proof). Let the internal angles of triangle $ABC$ be less than $120^{\\circ}$. The sum of the distances $AT + BT + CT$ from point $T$ to the vertices of the triangle is minimal if the sides of the triangle are seen from point $T$ at an angle of $120^{\\circ}$ ( $T$ is the Torricelli point of the triangle). If one of the angles of the triangle is greater than or equal to $120^{\\circ}$, then the point of minimum sum of distances will be the vertex of this angle.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Geometry, Solution:Solution. Suppose our road system has no intersections, that is, there is one road connecting the vertices of the square $E, F, G$ and $H$ sequentially. Then its length will be no less than three sides of the square (the letter \"\u041f\" in Fig. (a)), that is, no less than 12 (a road connecting adjacent vertices of the square is no less than its side).\n\nThus, the desired (and ideally the shortest) road system must have intersections (for example, as in Fig. (d)). To understand how the total length of the roads can be effectively reduced, it is useful to first note some properties that the shortest\n![](https:\/\/cdn.mathpix.com\/cropped\/2024_05_06_8f18e627c90a5374668dg-3.jpg?height=436&width=162&top_left_y=1389&top_left_x=1324)\n\n(r) road system must possess:\n\n![](https:\/\/cdn.mathpix.com\/cropped\/2024_05_06_8f18e627c90a5374668dg-3.jpg?height=234&width=194&top_left_y=1345&top_left_x=1505)\n\n(6)\n\n![](https:\/\/cdn.mathpix.com\/cropped\/2024_05_06_8f18e627c90a5374668dg-3.jpg?height=192&width=160&top_left_y=1620&top_left_x=1508)\n\n(a)\n\n![](https:\/\/cdn.mathpix.com\/cropped\/2024_05_06_8f18e627c90a5374668dg-3.jpg?height=186&width=228&top_left_y=1392&top_left_x=1688)\n\n(b)\n\n![](https:\/\/cdn.mathpix.com\/cropped\/2024_05_06_8f18e627c90a5374668dg-3.jpg?height=194&width=148&top_left_y=1619&top_left_x=1705)\n\n(e)\n\ni. The shortest road system consists of segments connecting intersections and the vertices of the square. This is obvious, as the shortest path from one point to another is a straight line segment. Note without proof, although this is almost obvious, that for any system of cities, the shortest road system connecting them is a connected graph without closed paths, whose edges are segments.\n\nii. Each intersection must be connected to at least three vertices of the graph (vertices of the square or intersections). (If it is connected to only two, then it makes little sense: it can be removed, and these two vertices can be connected directly; this will be shorter.)\n\niii. The angle between any two roads coming out of one intersection (or from one vertex of the square) cannot be less than $120^{\\circ}$. Indeed, let roads $AB$ and $AC$ come out of point $A$, and angle $BAC$ is less than $120^{\\circ}$. Then roads $AB$ and $AC$ can be replaced by roads with a smaller total length. If in triangle $ABC$ all internal angles are less than $120^{\\circ}$, then roads $AB$ and $AC$ are replaced by roads $TA, TB$, and $TC$, where $T$ is the Torricelli point of triangle $ABC$ (Fig. (b)). If, for example, angle $B$ is greater than $120^{\\circ}$, then $AB$ and $AC$ are replaced by $AB$ and $BC$ (Fig. (c)).\n\niv. Exactly three roads come out of one intersection at angles of $120^{\\circ}$ (otherwise, the length of the roads can be reduced). This immediately follows from properties (ii) and (iii).\n\nSuppose the road system has one intersection. If it is connected to all vertices (Fig. (g)), then the length of the roads is no less than the sum of the diagonals, which is $8\\sqrt{2} > 11$. If it is connected to only three vertices (Fig. (d)), then $T$ is the Torricelli point of triangle $EFH$, and vertex $G$ is connected to $F$. In this case, the length of the roads is approximately 11.7. Moreover, property (iii) is violated, as $\\angle THG < 120^{\\circ}$, which means the length of the roads can be reduced by adding another intersection (as in the case in Fig. (b)).\n\nSuppose there are two intersections. By symmetry, place them on an axis of symmetry parallel to two sides of the square (Fig. (e)) such that roads come out of each intersection at angles of $120^{\\circ}$ (property (iv)). In this case, the total length of the roads is $4 \\cdot (\\sqrt{3} + 1) < 10.92$.\n\nAnswer: For example, a road system with two intersections on an axis of symmetry parallel to two sides of the square (Fig. (e)). Roads come out of each intersection at angles of $120^{\\circ}$. Their total length is $4 \\cdot (\\sqrt{3} + 1) < 11$.\n\nComment. The road system in Fig. (e) is called the Steiner network of the given four points, the vertices of the square $E, F, G$, and $H$. Without proof, note that this system has the minimum length among all possible ones.<|im_end|>\n"}

How many pits are there that are less than the number $22222?$<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Combinatorics, Solution:Answer: 36\n\n## Solution.\n\nSuitable pits must start with 2, so the next is either 1 or 0. If the second position is occupied by the digit 1, then the third digit will not be greater than the second, so the condition is only satisfied by 0. Therefore, the third position is 0. The last two places can be occupied by any two different digits from 1 to 9. There are $9 \\cdot 8 \/ 2 = 36$ such pairs of digits, because we first choose a digit for the second-to-last place (from 1 to 9), and then from the remaining eight digits we choose the one that will go at the end (from 1 to 9, excluding the digit at the second-to-last position). Since the order of the digits matters, we divide the resulting number of ways by two, as the digits are divided into pairs of the form (a, b), (b, a).

(FRG 3) For all rational $x$ satisfying $0 \\leq x<1, f$ is defined by  \n$$ f(x)= \\begin{cases}f(2 x) \/ 4, & \\text { for } 0 \\leq x<1 \/ 2 \\\\ 3 \/ 4+f(2 x-1) \/ 4, & \\text { for } 1 \/ 2 \\leq x<1\\end{cases} $$  \nGiven that $x=0 . b_{1} b_{2} b_{3} \\ldots$ is the binary representation of $x$, find $f(x)$.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Other, Solution:8. By the definition of $f$, it holds that $f\\left(0 . b_{1} b_{2} \\ldots\\right)=3 b_{1} \/ 4+f\\left(0 . b_{2} b_{3} \\ldots\\right) \/ 4$ $=0 . b_{1} b_{1}+f\\left(0 . b_{2} b_{3} \\ldots\\right) \/ 4$. Continuing this argument we obtain  $$ f\\left(0 . b_{1} b_{2} b_{3} \\ldots\\right)=0 . b_{1} b_{1} \\ldots b_{n} b_{n}+\\frac{1}{2^{2 n}} f\\left(0 . b_{n+1} b_{n+2} \\ldots\\right) $$  The binary representation of every rational number is eventually periodic. Let us first determine $f(x)$ for a rational $x$ with the periodic representation $x=0 . \\overline{b_{1} b_{2} \\ldots b_{n}}$. Using (1) we obtain $f(x)=0 . b_{1} b_{1} \\ldots b_{n} b_{n}+f(x) \/ 2^{2 n}$, and hence $f(x)=\\frac{2^{n}}{2^{n}-1} 0 . b_{1} b_{1} \\ldots b_{n} b_{n}=0 . \\overline{b_{1} b_{1} \\ldots b_{n} b_{n}}$. Now let $x=0 . a_{1} a_{2} \\ldots a_{k} \\overline{b_{1} b_{2} \\ldots b_{n}}$ be an arbitrary rational number. Then it follows from (1) that $f(x)=0 . a_{1} a_{1} \\ldots a_{k} a_{k}+\\frac{1}{2^{2 n}} f\\left(0 . \\overline{b_{1} b_{2} \\ldots b_{n}}\\right)=0 . a_{1} a_{1} \\ldots a_{k} a_{k} \\overline{b_{1} b_{1} \\ldots b_{n} b_{n}}$. Hence $f\\left(0 . b_{1} b_{2} \\ldots\\right)=0 . b_{1} b_{1} b_{2} b_{2} \\ldots$ for every rational number $0 . b_{1} b_{2} \\ldots$.<|im_end|>\n"}

In village $A$, there are 100 schoolchildren, and in village $B$, there are 50 schoolchildren. The distance between the villages is 3 kilometers. At what point on the road from $A$ to $B$ should a school be built to minimize the total distance traveled by all schoolchildren?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Algebra, Solution:$\\triangle$ It seems fair to build the school closer to $A$, as there are more students there. But how much closer? Sometimes it is suggested to build the school one kilometer from $A$ and two kilometers from $B$ (twice as many students, so the school is twice as close). However, from the perspective of the given problem (minimizing the total distance traveled), this option is not the best; it is better to build the school directly at $A$.\n\n![](https:\/\/cdn.mathpix.com\/cropped\/2024_05_21_90703b5d5e76e3b5cd3dg-009.jpg?height=114&width=308&top_left_y=1502&top_left_x=380)\n\nThis can be verified as follows: if the distances from the school to $A$ and $B$ are $x$ and $3-x$ respectively, then the total distance traveled by all students is $100x + 50(3-x) = 100x + 150 - 50x = 50x + 150$, so it is minimized (and equals 150 km) when $x=0$. $\\triangleleft$\n\nThe same can be explained without formulas: each meter the school is moved towards $A$ reduces the distance for 100 students by one meter and increases the distance for 50 students by one meter, thus reducing the total distance by 50 meters.\n\nIt can also be said this way: divide all students at $A$ arbitrarily into two groups of 50 people each. If the second group did not exist, it would not matter where to build the school (the problem of the well) - but from the perspective of the second group, it is best to build it at $A$.\n\n## A Few More Problems<|im_end|>\n"}

Coins come in denominations of 50 kopecks, 1 ruble, 2 rubles, 5 rubles, 10 rubles. $V$ has several coins in his wallet. It is known that no matter which 20 coins are taken out of the wallet, there will be at least one 1-ruble coin, at least one 2-ruble coin, and at least one 5-ruble coin. What is the maximum number of coins in the wallet for this to be possible?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Combinatorics, Solution:Answer: 28\n\nSolution. Example: 9 coins of 1 ruble, 9 coins of 2 rubles, 9 coins of 5 rubles, and 1 coin of 10 rubles. Note that the wallet contains a total of $9+9+1=19$ coins that are not 1 ruble, so among any 20 coins, there will definitely be a 1-ruble coin. Similarly, this can be verified for all other denominations.\n\nEstimate: Suppose there are $x$ coins in the wallet. Since the number of coins not worth 1 ruble is no more than 19 (otherwise, there would be 20 coins without a 1-ruble coin), the number of 1-ruble coins must be at least $x-19$. Similarly for 2-ruble and 5-ruble coins. Therefore, the total number of coins is at least $3(x-19)$. We get the inequality $x \\geqslant 3 x-57$, from which $57 \\geqslant 2 x, 28.5 \\geqslant x$. Since $x$ is an integer, it does not exceed 28.<|im_end|>\n"}

Since \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) must be distinct, we cannot directly use \\( a = b = 1 \\). Instead, we can use \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( b = 2 \\):\n   \\[\n   f(1) + f(2) - f(3) = 2019\n   \\]\n   Now, consider \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( b = 3 \\):\n   \\[\n   f(1) + f(3) - f(4) = 2019\n   \\]\n   Similarly, for \\( a = 2 \\) and \\( b = 3 \\):\n   \\[\n   f(2) + f(3) - f(5) = 2019\n   \\]\n   We can see a pattern forming.

To find \\( f(a_1) + f(a_2) + \\ldots + f(a_{100}) - f(a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_{100}) \\), we use the given functional equation repeatedly. For any two distinct positive integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\):\n   \\[\n   f(a) + f(b) - f(a+b) = 2019\n   \\]\n   We can generalize this for 100 distinct positive integers \\( a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{100} \\). By applying the functional equation iteratively, we get:\n   \\[\n   f(a_1) + f(a_2) - f(a_1 + a_2) = 2019\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   f(a_1 + a_2) + f(a_3) - f(a_1 + a_2 + a_3) = 2019\n   \\]\n   Continuing this process for all 100 integers, we sum up the equations:\n   \\[\n   (f(a_1) + f(a_2) - f(a_1 + a_2)) + (f(a_1 + a_2) + f(a_3) - f(a_1 + a_2 + a_3)) + \\ldots + (f(a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_{99}) + f(a_{100}) - f(a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_{100})) = 2019 \\times 99\n   \\]\n   Notice that all intermediate terms \\( f(a_1 + a_2), f(a_1 + a_2 + a_3), \\ldots, f(a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_{99}) \\) cancel out, leaving:\n   \\[\n   f(a_1) + f(a_2) + \\ldots + f(a_{100}) - f(a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_{100}) = 2019 \\times 99\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the expression evaluates to:\n   \\[\n   2019 \\times 99 = 199881\n   \\]\n\nThe final answer is \\( \\boxed{199881} \\)<|im_end|>\n"}

Then there is a $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x)=c$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Now the functional equation reads:\n\n$$\nc=\\left(c+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(c+\\frac{1}{2}\\right),\n$$\n\nwhich can be rewritten as $0=c^{2}+\\frac{1}{4}$, but this has no real solution in $c$. Therefore, $f$ cannot be constant.\nThe only possibility is thus that $f(-1)=-\\frac{1}{2}$. This also means that $f(f(-1))=0$, so $f\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)=0$. Substitute $x=0$ and $y=-\\frac{1}{2}$, which gives:\n\n$$\nf\\left(f\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right)=\\left(f(0)+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(f\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\right),\n$$\n\nand thus\n\n$$\nf(0)=\\left(f(0)+\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\n\nfrom which it follows that $f(0)=\\frac{1}{2}$.\nSuppose there is an $a \\neq-1$ with $f(a)=-\\frac{1}{2}$. Substitute $y=a$:\n\n$$\nf\\left(x(1+a)-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)=0.\n$$\n\nSince $1+a \\neq 0$, $x(1+a)-\\frac{1}{2}$ can take all values in $\\mathbb{R}$ as $x$ varies over $\\mathbb{R}$. Therefore, it follows that $f$ is constantly 0, but we have already seen that $f$ cannot be constant. We conclude that there is no $a \\neq-1$ with $f(a)=-\\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, there is only one $x$ for which $f(x)=-\\frac{1}{2}$, and that is $x=-1$.\nConsider any $b$ with $f(b)=0$. We substitute $x=b-\\frac{1}{2}$ and $y=0$:\n\n$$\nf\\left(b-\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)=\\left(f\\left(b-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}\\right),\n$$\n\nor equivalently\n\n$$\nf(b)=\\left(f\\left(b-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\right).\n$$\n\nSince $f(b)=0$, it follows that $f\\left(b-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)=-\\frac{1}{2}$. We have seen that this implies $b-\\frac{1}{2}=-1$, so $b=-\\frac{1}{2}$.\nTherefore, there is only one $x$ for which $f(x)=0$, and that is $x=-\\frac{1}{2}$. Substitute $x=-1$:\n\n$$\nf(-1-y+f(y))=0\n$$\n\nFrom this, it follows that $-1-y+f(y)=-\\frac{1}{2}$, so $f(y)=y+\\frac{1}{2}$. The only candidate function is thus the function given by $f(x)=x+\\frac{1}{2}$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nWe check this function. On the left side of the functional equation, we get: $x+x y+y+1$. On the right side, we get $(x+1)(y+1)$, which is equal to $x y+x+y+1$. The function satisfies the equation.

If the guard asks for 199 coins, then by agreeing to give him this amount, the outsider will win the dispute and receive 100 coins. In total, he will lose 99 coins. If the outsider refuses, he will lose the dispute and lose 100 coins, which is less favorable (by 1 coin) for the one caught. If the guard demands 200, the outsider might refuse, as there is no difference in profit. If the guard demands more, it is more profitable for the outsider to refuse.

For each segment formed by a pair of these points, the midpoint of the segment is colored blue. How many blue points must there be, at a minimum?\n\nIf two midpoints coincide, they count as only one point.\n\n## Solutions<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Combinatorics, Solution:The answer is $2 n-3$.\n\nFirst, we can achieve this bound: we align the points on the integers of the x-axis $((0,0),(1,0), \\ldots,(n-1,0))$. Then the blue points will be exactly the points with integer or half-integer coordinates between $(0,0)$ and $(n-1,0)$ (thus $(0.5,0),(1,0),(1.5,0), \\ldots)$, which makes $2 n-3$ points.\n\nTo show that this bound is optimal, we introduce an x-axis, ensuring that each point has a different x-coordinate (this is possible since there are infinitely many directions for the axis, but only a finite number of points). We consider the leftmost and rightmost points. The leftmost point allows us to form $n-1$ midpoints with the remaining points (the x-coordinates of these $n-1$ midpoints are then distinct since all points have different x-coordinates). The rightmost point, on the other hand, also allows us to form $n-1$ distinct points by the same argument, but we have counted the midpoint formed by our two extreme points twice, so there are at least $(n-1)+(n-1)-1=2 n-3$ blue points.\n\n## V.

It is largely based on the written course by Igor Kortchemski, available on the POFM website. More specifically, it covers sections 1, 2.1, 2.2, and 2.6 of this course.\n\n## First definitions and operations\n\n## Definition 1.\n\nA function $P$ from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ is called a polynomial with real coefficients if there exists an integer $n \\geqslant 0$ and real numbers $a_{0}, a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n}$ such that\n\n$$\nP(x)=a_{n} x^{n}+a_{n-1} x^{n-1}+\\cdots+a_{1} x+a_{0}\n$$\n\nfor all real $x$.\n\nWe will see later, in Corollary 5, that, provided we choose $n$ to be minimal, this representation is unique. Once this result is admitted, we can then define the following concepts.\n\n## Definition 2.\n\nWhen $a_{n} \\neq 0$, we say that\n\n- the number $n$ is the degree of $P$; it is commonly denoted as deg $(P)$;\n- the numbers $a_{0}, a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n}$ are the coefficients of $P$; the number $a_{k}$ is called the coefficient of degree $k$ of $P ;{ }^{1}$\n- the number $a_{n}$ is the leading coefficient of $P$;\n- the number $a_{0}$ is the constant coefficient of $P$; it is thus called because, when $P$ is constant, the only value it takes is $a_{0}$.\n\nWhen the numbers $a_{0}, a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n}$ are all zero, we say that $P$ is the zero polynomial, and we define (somewhat arbitrarily, but this definition will prove practical) its degree as being equal to $-\\infty$.\n\nFinally, it may happen that we impose other constraints on the coefficients $a_{i}$. For example, we may be interested in polynomials $P$ for which these coefficients are non-negative or zero; strictly positive; rational; integers; or simply complex numbers, not necessarily real. ${ }^{2}$\n\nIn general, when $\\mathcal{E}$ is a set of numbers, we denote by $\\mathcal{E}[X]$ the set of polynomials whose coefficients belong to $\\mathcal{E}$. Thus, $\\mathbb{R}[X]$ denotes the set of polynomials with real coefficients, and $\\mathbb{Q}[X]$ the set of polynomials with rational coefficients.\n\nIn the following, we will use the notations $P$ and $P(X)$, or even $a_{n} X^{n}+a_{n-1} X^{n-1}+$ $\\cdots+a_{1} X+a_{0}$ interchangeably to denote this polynomial. However, we strongly advise against using the notation $P(x)$ to denote<|im_end|>\n"}

All other situations are winning situations.\n\nProof: By induction over $n \\geq 1$. For $n=1$, you win by taking the only remaining marble. For $n=2$, you can only take $k=1$ marble, and then your opponent wins on the next turn.\n\nInduction step from $n-1$ to $n$ for $n \\geq 3$:\n\n1. If $n$ is odd, take all $n$ marbles and win.\n2. If $n$ is even but not of the form $2^{a}-2$, then $n$ lies between two numbers of this form, so there is a unique integer $b$ with $2^{b}-2 < n < 2^{b+1}-2$. In this case, you can take $k = n - (2^{b}-2)$ marbles, leaving $2^{b}-2$ marbles on the table, which is a losing situation for your opponent. If $n$ is of the form $2^{a}-2$, then any number of marbles you take, $k$, will leave a number of marbles that is not of the form $2^{a}-2$. Specifically, if you take $k$ marbles, the number of marbles left is $n - k = 2^{a}-2 - k$. For $k$ to be a valid move, $1 \\leq k \\leq \\frac{n}{2} = 2^{a-1}-1$. If $k = 2^{a-1}-1$, then $n - k = 2^{a-1}-1$, which is not of the form $2^{a}-2$. For any other $k$, $n - k$ will also not be of the form $2^{a}-2$. Therefore, your opponent will always be left with a winning situation.\n\nSolution to the problem: Berta can force a win if and only if $N$ is of the form $2^{a}-2$. The smallest number $N \\geq 100000$ of this form is $N=2^{17}-2=131070$.\n\n(Gerhard Woeginger)<|im_end|>\n"}

Suppose we can build $T_m$ towers using blocks of size $1, 2, \\ldots, m$.  How many towers can we build using blocks of size $1, 2, \\ldots, m, m + 1$?  If we remove the block of size $m + 1$ from such a tower (keeping all other blocks in order), we get a valid tower using blocks $1, 2, \\ldots, m$.  Given a tower using blocks $1, 2, \\ldots, m$ (with $m \\geq 2$), we can insert the block of size $m + 1$ in exactly 3 places: at the beginning, immediately following the block of size $m - 1$ or immediately following the block of size $m$.  Thus, there are 3 times as many towers using blocks of size $1, 2, \\ldots, m, m + 1$ as there are towers using only $1, 2, \\ldots, m$.  There are 2 towers which use blocks $1, 2$, so there are $2\\cdot 3^6 = 1458$ towers using blocks $1, 2, \\ldots, 8$, so the answer is $\\boxed{458}$.\n(Note that we cannot say, \"there is one tower using the block $1$, so there are $3^7$ towers using the blocks $1, 2, \\ldots, 8$.\"  The reason this fails is that our recursion only worked when $m \\geq 2$: when $m = 1$, there are only 2 places to insert a block of size $m + 1 = 2$, at the beginning or at the end, rather than the 3 places we have at later stages.  Also, note that this method generalizes directly to seeking the number of towers where we change the second rule to read, \"The cube immediately on top of a cube with edge-length $k$ must have edge-length at most $k + n$,\" where $n$ can be any fixed integer.)<|im_end|>\n"}

Indeed, a strictly positive multiple of 10 can be written as $10 \\mathrm{k}, \\mathrm{k} \\in \\mathbb{N}^{*}$. Then its square is $100 \\mathrm{k}^{2}$, and if we remove the last two digits of its representation, which are zeros, we get $\\mathrm{k}^{2}$, which is indeed a perfect square.\n\nb) If $n$ is strictly less than 10, its square has at most two digits, so by removing them, we get zero according to the convention in the statement. If $n$ satisfies the property without being a multiple of 10, $n^{2}$ is not a multiple of 100. Let $\\mathrm{d}$ be the number such that $\\mathrm{d}^{2}$ is equal to $\\mathrm{n}^{2}$ with its last two digits removed. Then $\\mathrm{n}^{2}$ and $(10 \\mathrm{~d})^{2}$ are distinct perfect squares whose difference is at most 99, because the representation of $(10 \\mathrm{~d})^{2}$ is obtained by replacing the last two digits of that of $\\mathrm{n}^{2}$ with zeros. Since $(10 \\mathrm{~d})^{2}<\\mathrm{n}^{2}$, we have $10 \\mathrm{~d}<\\mathrm{n}$. But $10 \\mathrm{~d}$ and $n$ are integers, so $n \\geqslant 10 \\mathrm{~d}+1$, thus $\\mathrm{n}^{2} \\geqslant(10 \\mathrm{~d})^{2}+2 \\times 10 \\mathrm{~d}+1$. Since $n^{2} \\leqslant(10 \\mathrm{~d})^{2}+99$, we have $10 \\mathrm{~d} \\leqslant 48$. Since $\\mathrm{d}$ is an integer, $\\mathrm{d} \\leqslant 4$, so $10 \\mathrm{~d} \\leqslant 40$ and $(10 \\mathrm{~d})^{2} \\leqslant 1600$. Thus, $\\mathrm{n}^{2} \\leqslant 1699$, or $\\mathrm{n} \\leqslant 41$ since $n$ is an integer. If the last digit of $n$ is not 1, $n \\geqslant 10 d+2$ so $n^{2} \\geqslant(10 d)^{2}+40 d+4$ and we find $\\mathrm{d} \\leqslant 2$. If the last digit of $\\mathrm{n}$ is neither 1 nor 2, $n \\geqslant 10 \\mathrm{~d}+3$ and we find similarly $\\mathrm{d} \\leqslant 1$. If it is neither 1, nor 2, nor 3, nor 4, $n \\geqslant 10 d+5$ and we find $d=0$. Thus, we still need to test $11,12,13,14,21,22,31$ and 41, which we quickly verify are solutions, in addition to $1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8$ and 9.<|im_end|>\n"}

Therefore, the total number of connected pairs of subscribers is $2001n \/ 2$, since each connected pair has exactly two connection directions.

Since each good circle passes through exactly 3 pairs, there are at least 4 different good circles, i.e., $n \\geqslant 4$.\n\nWith 5 points, 10 line segments can be formed, each of which is a chord of an odd number (1 or 3) of good circles. The sum of 10 odd numbers is even, and each good circle has exactly 3 chords, so $n$ is even.\n\nIf $n \\geqslant 6$, then at least $\\frac{3 \\times 6 - 10}{2} = 4$ line segments are common chords of 3 good circles. 4 line segments have 8 endpoints, so there must be two line segments with a common endpoint, say $AB$ and $AC$. Thus, the circles $ABD$ and $ACD$ are both good circles, so there are at least 2 good circles passing through $A$ and $D$, and of course, there must be 3. Similarly, there are 3 good circles passing through $A$ and $E$. By symmetry, assume the shortest line segment among $AB, AC, AD, AE$ is $AB$. Then $\\angle ACB, \\angle ADB, \\angle AEB$ are all acute angles. From the previous discussion, if $C, D, E$ are on the same side of line $AB$, then there is only one good circle passing through $A$ and $B$; if $C, D, E$ are on different sides of line $AB$, then since the sum of any two angles among $\\angle ACB, \\angle ADB, \\angle AEB$ is less than $180^{\\circ}$, there is also only one good circle passing through $A$ and $B$.

We will show that for other $\\lambda$ values, there is no positive integer solution.\n\nSuppose for a certain $\\lambda$ there is a solution, and consider a solution for which $x+y+z+v$ is minimal. By symmetry, we can assume that $x \\leq y \\leq z \\leq v$.\n\nFirst, we prove that\n\n$$\nv \\leq \\frac{\\lambda x y z}{2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad v \\leq \\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}}\n$$\n\nConsider (1) as a quadratic equation in $v$. According to the relationships between roots and coefficients (Vieta's formulas), the other root is\n\n$$\nv_{1}=\\lambda x y z - v = \\frac{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}}{v}\n$$\n\nFrom the first formula, it is clear that $v_{1}$ is also an integer, and from the second formula, it is clear that $v_{1}$ is positive. This means that (1) also has the solution $(x, y, z, v_{1})$. Since $x+y+z+v$ is minimal, $v \\leq v_{1}$, which implies (2) holds by (3).\n\nThe following estimate provides an upper bound for $\\lambda$:\n\n$$\n\\lambda x y z = x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2} + v^{2} \\leq x v + y v + z v + v \\frac{\\lambda x y z}{2} \\leq \\left(3 + \\frac{\\lambda}{2}\\right) x y z v\n$$\n\nFrom this, $\\lambda \\leq 3 + \\frac{\\lambda}{2}$, or $\\lambda \\leq 6$.\n\nIf none of $x, y, z, v$ are even, then the left side is divisible by 4, but the right side $x y z v$ is odd, so $\\lambda$ must be divisible by 4; this is only possible if $\\lambda=4$.\n\nIf one or three of $x, y, z, v$ are even, then the right side is even, but the left side is odd, which is a contradiction.\n\nIf two of $x, y, z, v$ are even, then the left side gives a remainder of 2 when divided by 4, but the right side is divisible by 4, which is also a contradiction.\n\nFinally, if all of $x, y, z, v$ are even, then the (4) estimate can be refined slightly:\n\n$$\n\\lambda x y z v \\leq x v + y v + z v + v \\frac{\\lambda x y z}{2} \\leq \\left(\\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{\\lambda}{2}\\right) x y z v; \\quad \\text{from this, } \\lambda \\leq \\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{\\lambda}{2}, \\text{ or } \\lambda=1\n$$\n\nTherefore, a positive integer solution is only possible for $\\lambda=1$ and $\\lambda=4$.\n\nRemarks. 1. According to (3), for both $\\lambda$ values, infinitely many solutions can be constructed, since one of $x, y, z, v$ - for example, the smallest one - can be replaced by a larger integer.\n\n2. A very similar equation $\\left(x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2} = k x y z\\right)$ is examined in the book \"Selected Problems and Theorems in Elementary Mathematics\" by Jaglom-Skljarszkij-Csencov (Volume 1, Problem 118, Tank\u00f6nyvkiad\u00f3, 1967), and the solutions of the two problems are essentially the same. Many have rewritten the proof described there for equation (1). Unfortunately, the solution in the book contains several inaccuracies, and some contestants did not correct them. Many, following the book, defined the number $v_{1}$ by the formula $v_{1} = \\lambda x y z - v$ and verified by substitution that the quadruple $(x, y, z, v_{1})$ is also a solution to (1). However - like in the book - they forgot to justify why $v_{1}$ is positive. (These contestants received 4 points.) Two even got entangled in the same copying mistake, as they copied the most critical sentences word for word from the book.<|im_end|>\n"}

The answer is 15 .\nNote that there are 14 primes at most $\\sqrt{2022}$, starting with 2 and ending with 43 . Thus, the following partition works for 15 sets. Let $S_{1}=\\{2,4, \\ldots, 2022\\}$, the multiples of 2 in $S$. Let $S_{2}=\\{3,9,15 \\ldots, 2019\\}$, the remaining multiples of 3 in $S$ not in $S_{1}$. Let $S_{3}=\\{5,25,35, \\ldots, 2015\\}$ the remaining multiples of 5 , and so on and so forth, until we get to $S_{14}=\\{43,1849,2021\\}$. $S_{15}$ consists of the remaining elements, i.e. 1 and those numbers with no prime factors at most 43 , i.e., the primes greater than 43 but less than 2022: $S_{15}=\\{1,47,53,59, \\ldots, 2017\\}$. Each of $S_{1}, S_{2}, \\ldots, S_{14}$ satisfies i., while $S_{15}$ satisfies ii.\nWe show now that no partition in 14 subsets is possible. Let a Type 1 subset of $S$ be a subset $S_{i}$ for which i. is true and there exists an integer $d>1$ for which $d$ divides every element of $S_{i}$. Let a Type 2 subset of $S$ be a subset $S_{i}$ for which ii. is true. Finally, let a Type 3 subset of $S$ be a subset $S_{i}$ for which i. is true that is not a Type 1 subset. An example of a Type 3 subset would be a set of the form $\\{p q, q r, p r\\}$ where $p, q, r$ are distinct primes.\nClaim: Let $p_{1}=2, p_{2}=3, p_{3}=5, \\ldots$ be the sequence of prime numbers, where $p_{k}$ is the $k$ th prime. Every optimal partition of the set $S(k):=\\left\\{1,2, \\ldots, p_{k}^{2}\\right\\}$, i.e., a partition with the least possible number of subsets, has at least $k-1$ Type 1 subsets. In particular, every optimal partition of this set has $k+1$ subsets in total. To see how this follows, we look at two cases:\n- If every prime $p \\leq p_{k}$ has a corresponding Type 1 subset containing its multiples, then a similar partitioning to the above works: Take $S_{1}$ to $S_{k}$ as Type 1 subsets for each prime, and take $S_{k+1}$ to be everything left over. $S_{k+1}$ will never be empty, as it has 1 in it. While in fact it is known that, for example, by Bertrand's postulate there is always some prime between $p_{k}$ and $p_{k}^{2}$ so $S_{k+1}$ has at least two elements, there is no need to go this far-if there were no other primes you could just move 2 from $S_{1}$ into $S_{k+1}$, and if $k>1$ then $S_{1}$ will still have at least three elements remaining. And if $k=1$, there is no need to worry about this, because $21$ for all $x$ in the same set as $p$, then $\\operatorname{gcd}(p, x)=p$, which implies that $p$ is in a Type 1 set with $d=p$. Similarly, if $\\operatorname{gcd}\\left(p^{2}, x\\right)>1$ for all $x$ in the same set as $p^{2}$, then $p \\mid \\operatorname{gcd}\\left(p^{2}, x\\right)$ for all $x$, and so $p^{2}$ is in a Type 1 set with $d=p$ as well. Hence $p$ and $p^{2}$ must in fact be in Type 2 sets, and they cannot be in the same Type 2 set (as they share a common factor of $p>1$ ); this means that the optimal partition has at least $k+1$ subsets in total. A possible equality scenario for example is the sets $S_{1}=\\left\\{1,2,3,5, \\ldots, p_{k}\\right\\}, S_{2}=\\left\\{4,9,25, \\ldots, p_{k}^{2}\\right\\}$, and $S_{3}$ to $S_{k+1}$ Type 1 sets taking all remaining multiples of $2,3,5, \\ldots, p_{k-1}$. This works, as $p_{k}$ and $p_{k}^{2}$ are the only multiples of $p_{k}$ in $S(k)$ with no prime factor other than $p_{k}$ and thus cannot be classified into some other Type 1 set.\n\nTo prove our claim: We proceed by induction on $k$. Trivially, this is true for $k=1$. Suppose now that any optimal partition of the set $S(k)$ has at least $k-1$ Type 1 subsets, and thus at least $k+1$ subsets in total. Consider now a partition of the set $S(k+1)$, and suppose that this partition would have at most $k+1$ subsets. From the above, there exist at least two primes $p, q$ with $p<q \\leq p_{k+1}$ for which there are no Type 1 subsets. If $q<p_{k+1}$ we have a contradiction. Any such partition can be restricted to an optimal partition of $S(k)$ with $p<q \\leq p_{k}$ having no corresponding Type 1 subsets. This contradicts our inductive hypothesis. On the other hand, suppose that $q=p_{k+1}$. Again restricting to $S(k)$ gives us an optimal partition of $S(k)$ with at most $k-1$ Type 1 sets; the inductive hypothesis tells us that this partition has in fact exactly $k-1$ Type 1 sets and two Type 2 sets from a previous argument establishing the consequence of the claim. However, consider now the element $p q$. This cannot belong in any Type 1 set, neither can it belong in the same Type 2 set as $p$ or $p^{2}$. Thus in addition to the given $k-1$ Type 1 sets and 2 Type 2 sets, we need an extra set to contain $p q$. Thus our partition of $S(k+1)$ in fact has at least $k-1+2+1=k+2$ subsets, and not $k+1$ subsets as we wanted. The claim is thus proved.\nReturning to our original problem, since $p_{14}=43<\\sqrt{2022}$, any partition of $S$ must restrict to a partition of $S(14)$, which we showed must have at least 15 sets. Thus, we can do no better than 15 .<|im_end|>\n"}

Let $d_{2}$ be the distance in kilometres that Gina had ran when her average rate was 7 minutes 5 seconds per kilometre.\n\nThe distance we seek is $d_{2}-d_{1}$.\n\nSince 7 minutes 30 seconds was the average rate when the distance was $d_{1}$ kilometres, $\\frac{15}{2} \\times d_{1}$ minutes passed from the time Gina started the app to when she had ran $d_{1}$ kilometres. We are using that 7 minutes 30 seconds is equal to $\\frac{15}{2}$ minutes.\n\nOn the other hand, Gina ran at a constant rate of 7 minutes per kilometre, so it took $7 d_{1}$ minutes for her to run $d_{1}$ kilometres once she started moving.\n\nSince 15 seconds equals $\\frac{1}{4}$ minute, this means that $\\frac{1}{4}+7 d_{1}$ minutes passed from the time Gina started the app to the time she had ran $d_{1}$ kilometres.\n\nThis gives the equation $\\frac{15}{2} d_{1}=\\frac{1}{4}+7 d_{1}$ which can be solved for $d_{1}$ to get $d_{1}=\\frac{1}{2}$ kilometre.\n\nSince 5 seconds equals $\\frac{1}{12}$ minute, 7 minutes 5 seconds equals $\\frac{85}{12}$ minutes.\n\nUsing calculations similar to those involving $d_{1}$, we can obtain the equation $\\frac{85}{12} d_{2}=\\frac{1}{4}+7 d_{2}$, which can be solved for $d_{2}$ to get $d_{2}=3$ kilometres.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $d_{2}-d_{1}=3-\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{5}{2}$ kilometres or 2.5 kilometres.\n\nANSWER: $2.5 \\mathrm{~km}$<|im_end|>\n"}

Tim has a working analog 12 -hour clock with two hands that run continuously (instead of, say, jumping on the minute). He also has a clock that runs really slow-at half the correct rate, to be exact.

At how many times during that day are the angles on the two clocks equal?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Logic and Puzzles, Solution:Answer: 33\nSolution: A tricky thing about this problem may be that the angles on the two clocks might be reversed and would still count as being the same (for example, both angles could be $90^{\\circ}$, but the hour hand may be ahead of the minute hand on one clock and behind on the other).\nLet $x,-12 \\leq x<12$, denote the number of hours since noon. If we take $0^{\\circ}$ to mean upwards to the \"XII\" and count angles clockwise, then the hour and minute hands of the correct clock are at $30 x^{\\circ}$ and $360 x^{\\circ}$, and those of the slow clock are at $15 x^{\\circ}$ and $180 x^{\\circ}$. The two angles are thus $330 x^{\\circ}$ and $165 x^{\\circ}$, of course after removing multiples of $360^{\\circ}$ and possibly flipping sign; we are looking for solutions to\n$$\n330 x^{\\circ} \\equiv 165 x^{\\circ} \\quad\\left(\\bmod 360^{\\circ}\\right) \\text { or } 330 x^{\\circ} \\equiv-165 x^{\\circ} \\quad\\left(\\bmod 360^{\\circ}\\right) .\n$$\n\nIn other words,\n$$\n360 \\mid 165 x \\text { or } 360 \\mid 495 x \\text {. }\n$$\n\nOr, better yet,\n$$\n\\frac{165}{360} x=\\frac{11}{24} x \\text { and } \/ \\text { or } \\frac{495}{360} x=\\frac{11}{8} x\n$$\nmust be an integer.

Any of the three sides, $4$, $5$, or $x$, could be the second longest side of the triangle.\nThe law of cosines can be applied to solve for $x$ in all three cases.\nWhen the second longest side is $5$, we get that $5^2 = 4^2 + x^2 - 2(4)(x)\\cos 60^{\\circ}$, therefore $x^2 - 4x - 9 = 0$.

If the numbers $n$ and $n+2$ have a common divisor, then it is a divisor of their difference, 2. Thus, if the number $n$ is odd, then all three numbers $n, n+1, n+2$ are pairwise coprime, so $\\operatorname{HOK}(n, n+1, n+2) = n(n+1)(n+2)$. If $n$ is even, then $\\operatorname{HOK}(n, n+1, n+2) = n(n+1)(n+2) \/ 2$. Clearly, $\\operatorname{HOK}(n+1, n+2, n+3)$ can be less than $\\operatorname{HOK}(n, n+1, n+2)$ only if $n$ is odd.

His wife, however, wants the opposite:\n\n- the number of indigo tiles should be at least as many as the total number of red, orange, yellow, green, and blue tiles;\n- the number of blue tiles should be at least as many as the total number of red, orange, yellow, and green tiles;\n- the number of green tiles should be at least as many as the total number of red, orange, and yellow tiles;\n- the number of yellow tiles should be at least as many as the total number of red and orange tiles;\n- the number of orange tiles should be at least as many as the number of red tiles.\n\nThe floor requires 100 tiles.\n\nHow many green tiles will be needed if the most preferable variant for the client is chosen, which also meets the conditions set by his wife?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Logic and Puzzles, Solution:Answer: 13.\n\nSolution: According to the conditions set by the customer's wife, there must be at least as many indigo tiles as all the others combined. This means there must be at least 50 tiles, which is half of all the tiles. The customer clearly wants the number of indigo tiles to be as few as possible. Therefore, in the desired variant, there will be exactly 50 indigo tiles.\n\nNow we have moved to a similar problem: without the indigo color, and we need $100-50=50$ tiles. Reasoning similarly, we get that there should be 25 blue tiles.\n\nAnd once again, we have moved to a similar problem: now without the blue color, and we need $50-25=25$ tiles.

If their intersection is nonempty, it must contain \\( 1 \\). The minimal element of their intersection is \\( 1 \\), which is not the maximal element of either \\( A \\) or \\( B \\) (since \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are not \\(\\{1\\}\\)). Thus, the condition is satisfied.\n\n4. **Prove optimality using induction:**\n   We need to show that \\( 2^{99} - 1 \\) is the maximum number of such subsets. We will use induction on \\( n \\), the cardinality of \\( S \\).\n\n   - **Base case \\( n = 2 \\):**\n     For \\( S = \\{1, 2\\} \\), the subsets are \\(\\{1\\}, \\{2\\}, \\{1, 2\\}\\). The pairs \\((\\{2\\}, \\{1, 2\\})\\) form a \"horrible\" pair because their intersection \\(\\{2\\}\\) is the maximal element of \\(\\{2\\}\\). Thus, we can only choose one subset from each pair, giving us \\( 2^{1} - 1 = 1 \\) subset.\n\n   - **Inductive step:**\n     Assume the statement holds for \\( n = k \\). For \\( n = k+1 \\), consider the set \\( S = \\{1, 2, \\ldots, k+1\\} \\). By the induction hypothesis, we can pair all nonempty subsets of \\( \\{1, 2, \\ldots, k\\} \\) into \"horrible\" pairs. We need to pair all nonempty subsets of \\( S \\) containing \\( k+1 \\) into \"horrible\" pairs. For any subsets \\( A, B \\) of \\( \\{1, 2, \\ldots, k\\} \\) such that \\( A \\cup B = \\{1, 2, \\ldots, k\\} \\) and \\( |A| + |B| = k \\), we can pair \\( \\{k+1\\} \\cup A \\) with \\( \\{k+1\\} \\cup B \\). This completes the induction.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   Since we can pair all nonempty subsets of \\( S \\) except for \\(\\{1\\}\\) into \"horrible\" pairs, we can pick at most one subset from each pair. This gives us an upper bound of \\( 1 + \\frac{2^{100} - 2}{2} = 2^{99} \\). However, to achieve equality, we need \\(\\{1\\}\\) to be chosen, which would prevent any other subset containing \\( 1 \\) from being chosen. Thus, the maximum number of subsets is \\( 2^{99} - 1 \\).\n\nThe final answer is \\( \\boxed{ 2^{99} - 1 } \\).<|im_end|>\n"}

We distribute the integers $1, 2, \\ldots, 8$ into two sets $A$ and $B$, then we denote $P_{A}$ as the product of all elements in $A$ and $P_{B}$ as the product of all elements in $B$.\n\nWhat are the minimum and maximum values that the sum $P_{A} + P_{B}$ can take?\n\nNote: if a set $E$ is empty, we consider the product of its elements to be equal to 1.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Combinatorics, Solution:Solution to Exercise 2 Let $A$ and $B$ be two disjoint sets whose union is equal to the set $E=\\{1, \\ldots, 8\\}$.\n\nFirst, let's try to maximize the sum $P_{A}+P_{B}$. Without loss of generality, we can assume that $P_{A} \\leqslant P_{B}$. Then, if $A$ contains an integer $k \\geqslant 2$, we set $A^{\\prime}=A \\backslash\\{k\\}$ and $B^{\\prime}=$ $B \\cup\\{k\\}$. Then\n\n$$\nP_{A^{\\prime}}+P_{B^{\\prime}} \\geqslant P_{B^{\\prime}}=k P_{B} \\geqslant 2 P_{B} \\geqslant P_{A}+P_{B}\n$$\n\nThus, when the sum $P_{A}+P_{B}$ reaches its maximum value, we know that $A \\subseteq\\{1\\}$, so $P_{A}=1$ and $P_{B}=8!$, hence $P_{A}+P_{B}=8!+1=40321$.\n\nNow, let's try to minimize the sum $P_{A}+P_{B}$. The arithmetic-geometric inequality indicates that $P_{A}+P_{B} \\geqslant 2 c$, where we have set $c=\\sqrt{P_{A} P_{B}}=\\sqrt{8!}$. Since $401^{2}=160801401$, and thus $P_{A}+P_{B} \\geqslant\\lceil 2 c\\rceil \\geqslant 402$.\n\nA first instinct is therefore to look for two sets $A$ and $B$ such that $P_{A}+P_{B}=402$. We then make some preliminary remarks to this search. First, knowing which set contains the integer 1 makes no difference. Then we prove that one of the two sets contains the integer 6 and the other contains the integers 2 and 3. Indeed, let $X$ be the set that contains 6 and $Y$ the one that does not contain 6:\n\n$\\triangleright$ since $P_{Y} \\equiv 402-P_{X} \\equiv 0(\\bmod 6)$, it follows that $Y$ contains the integer 3 and an even integer;\n\n$\\triangleright$ if it is $X$ that contains the integer 2, then $P_{Y} \\equiv 402-P_{X} \\equiv 2(\\bmod 4)$, so $X$ contains an even integer but not divisible by 4, which is impossible.\n\nBy removing the integers $1,2,3$ and 6 from the sets $A$ and $B$, we are thus reduced to finding a partition of the set $\\hat{E}=\\{4,5,7,8\\}$ into two subsets $\\hat{A}$ and $\\hat{B}$ such that $P_{\\hat{A}}+$ $P_{\\hat{B}}=402 \/ 6=67$. Suppose, without loss of generality, that $\\hat{A}$ contains the integer 4. Then $P_{\\hat{B}} \\equiv 67-P_{\\hat{A}} \\equiv 1(\\bmod 2)$, so $\\hat{A}$ also contains the integer 8. Furthermore, if $\\hat{A}$ also contains one of the two integers 5 or 7, then $P_{\\hat{A}}+P_{\\hat{B}} \\geqslant P_{\\hat{A}} \\geqslant 4 \\times 5 \\times 8 \\geqslant 160>67$. Therefore, we must necessarily have $\\hat{A}=\\{4,8\\}$ and $\\hat{B}=\\{5,7\\}$, and we are happy to verify that, in this case, we indeed have $P_{\\hat{A}}+P_{\\hat{B}}=32+35=67$.\n\nIn conclusion, the maximum value of $P_{A}+P_{B}$ is equal to $P_{\\emptyset}+P_{E}=8!+1=40321$, and the minimum value of $P_{A}+P_{B}$ is equal to $P_{\\{2,3,5,7\\}}+P_{\\{1,4,6,8\\}}=402$.<|im_end|>\n"}

We will show that the equation has no other solution.\n\nIf $y \\neq 0$, then since $y$ is an integer, $4 y-1$ is also not zero. Thus, according to (1), the product on the right side, $y^{2}(4 y-1)$, is a non-zero perfect square. One of the factors, $y^{2}$, is itself a perfect square, so the product can only be a perfect square if the second factor, $4 y-1=4(y-1)+3$, is also a perfect square. This, however, is impossible, since perfect squares give a remainder of 0 or 1 when divided by 4.\n\nTherefore, the only solution to the equation is $x=y=0$.\n\nII. solution. From the equation, we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nx^{2}=2 x y-2 y^{2}+4 y^{3}, \\text { and } \\\\\n2 y^{2}=2 x y-x^{2}+4 y^{3}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nFrom (2a), it is clear that $x$ is even, so the right side of (2b) is divisible by 4. Thus, $y^{2}$ is also even, and therefore divisible by 4. From (2a) again, it then follows that $8 \\mid x^{2}$, which can only be true if $4 \\mid x$. The reasoning can be continued, and we get that both $x$ and $y$ are divisible by any positive integer power of 2, which can only be true if $x$ and $y$ are both zero.\n\nThe above reasoning is merely an outline. The \"continuability\" of what is said must be proven in a real proof, as this is the key to the solution. It can be proven by induction; we do not detail this here, instead, we take a seemingly different path.\n\nIf either $x$ or $y$ is not zero, let $d$ be the largest exponent for which $2^{d}$ divides both $x$ and $y$. Then, according to (2a), $x^{2}$ is divisible by $2^{2 d+1}$, and since in the factorization of a perfect square, every prime number appears with an even exponent, $x^{2}$ is also divisible by $2^{2 d+2}$, so $x$ is divisible by $2^{d+1}$.\n\nUsing this in (2b), we get that $2 y^{2}$ is divisible by $2^{2 d+2}$, i.e., $y^{2}$ is divisible by $2^{2 d+1}$. This, however, is a contradiction, since by our assumption, $2^{d}$ was the largest power of 2 by which both $x$ and $y$ are divisible.\n\nThe contradiction implies that neither $x$ nor $y$ can be non-zero. The pair $(0,0)$ is clearly a solution, so we have solved the problem.\n\nRemarks. 1. Both solutions used the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which states that positive integers can be uniquely expressed as a product of primes.\n\n2. In the second solution, we showed that if $x$ and $y$ are divisible by $2^{d}$, then they are also divisible by $2^{d+1}$. Since every integer is divisible by $2^{0}=1$, this is essentially the induction proof mentioned.<|im_end|>\n"}

In each cell of a $2017 \\times 2017$ grid, there is a lamp, and each lamp has only two states: on or off. A lamp is called \"bad\" if and only if there is an even number of lamps that are on among its adjacent lamps. Find the minimum possible number of bad lamps in this $2017 \\times 2017$ grid.\n\nNote: If two lamps are in cells that share an edge, then these two lamps are considered adjacent.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Combinatorics, Solution:3. Color each cell of a $2017 \\times 2017$ grid in a checkerboard pattern, with the cell in the first row and first column being black. A lamp in a black cell is called a black lamp, and a lamp in a white cell is called a white lamp. Assign a value of 1 to a lamp that is on, and 0 to a lamp that is off.\n\nUsing the center of the central cell of the grid as the origin, and the directions parallel and perpendicular to the grid lines as the $x$-axis and $y$-axis respectively, with the side length of each cell as the unit length, establish a Cartesian coordinate system. Assume that each lamp is located at the center of its cell, and use the coordinates of the cell to represent its position.\n\nThus, the lamp at position $(i, j)$ is a black lamp if and only if $i+j$ is even.\n\nIf there are no faulty lamps, i.e., each lamp is adjacent to an odd number of lamps that are on.\n\nFor the lamp at position $(i, j)$, let $a_{i, j}$ be the sum of the values of the adjacent lamps, and let $S$ be the sum of all $a_{i, j}$ where both $i$ and $j$ are even.\n\nOn one hand, note that each $a_{i, j}$ is odd, and there are an odd number of $(i, j)$ where both $i$ and $j$ are even, so $S$ is odd.\n\nOn the other hand, for a black lamp at position $(i, j)$ where both $i$ and $j$ are even, each adjacent white lamp is adjacent to exactly two black lamps at positions where both coordinates are even, meaning each such white lamp contributes twice its value to $S$, which is even. Therefore, $S$ is the sum of several even numbers, leading to a contradiction.\nThus, there must be at least one faulty lamp.\nConsider the following scenario.\nFor a black lamp at position $(i, j)$:\nIf $\\max \\{|i|,|j|\\} \\equiv 0,1(\\bmod 4)$, then assign a value of 0;\n\nIf $\\max \\{|i|,|j|\\} \\equiv 2,3(\\bmod 4)$, then assign a value of 1.\nFor a white lamp at position $(i, j)$:\nIf $\\max \\{|i|,|j|-1\\} \\equiv 0,1(\\bmod 4)$, then assign a value of 0;\n\nIf $\\max \\{|i|,|j|-1\\} \\equiv 2,3(\\bmod 4)$, then assign a value of 1.\n\nIn this case, for a white lamp at position $(i, j)$, since $i$ and $j$ have different parities, assume $|i| < |j|$. Similar to the analysis for white lamps above, this lamp is not faulty.\nIn summary, the minimum possible number of faulty lamps is 1.<|im_end|>\n"}

From the identity given in the problem, it follows that the sought polynomial $P(x)=P_{n}(x)$ (where $n$ is the degree of the polynomial) is divisible by $x$, i.e., $P_{n}(x)=x P_{n-1}(x)$, where $P_{n-1}(x)$ is some new polynomial of degree $n-1$. Therefore,\n\n$$\nP(x-1)=(x-1) P_{n-1}(x-1)\n$$\n\nand, hence,\n\n$$\nx(x-1) P_{n-1}(x-1)=x P(x-1)=(x-26) P(x),\n$$\n\nwhich implies that $P(x)$ is also divisible by $x-1$, i.e., $P_{n}(x)=x(x-1) P_{n-2}(x)$ (since $P_{n-1}(x)=(x-1) P_{n-2}(x)$ is divisible by $x-1$).

Substituting this value of $P(x)$ into the original relation, we similarly verify that $P(x)$ is also divisible by $x-3$, i.e., $P_{n}(x)=$ $=x(x-1)(x-2)(x-3) P_{n-3}(x)$, and so on.\n\nContinuing in this manner, we eventually arrive at the following form of the polynomial $P(x)$:\n\n$$\nP(x)=P_{n}(x)=x(x-1)(x-2)(x-3) \\ldots(x-25) P_{n-26}(x) .\n$$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $P(x)$ into the given identity, we get:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& x(x-1)(x-2) \\ldots(x-26) P_{n-26}(x-1)= \\\\\n&=(x-26) x(x-1) \\ldots(x-25) P_{n-26}(x),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nfrom which it follows that for the polynomial $P_{n-26}(x) \\equiv Q(x)$ of degree $n-26$\n\n$$\nQ(x-1) \\equiv Q(x)\n$$\n\nIt is clear that if $Q(x)=Q_{0}(x)=c$ is a polynomial of degree zero (a constant!), then the relation (*) holds; we will show that it holds only in this case.

Let's call these 6 teams successful, and the remaining 9 teams unsuccessful. We will call a game between two successful teams an internal game, and a game between a successful and an unsuccessful team an external game.\n\nFirst, note that for each game, the participating teams collectively earn no more than 3 points. Clearly, there were exactly $\\frac{6 \\cdot 5}{2}=15$ internal games, and only from these games did all successful teams collectively earn no more than $15 \\cdot 3=45$ points. There were exactly $6 \\cdot 9=54$ external games, and in each such game, a successful team earned no more than 3 points. Therefore, collectively, all successful teams earned no more than $54 \\cdot 3=162$ points from external games. According to the problem, the successful teams collectively earned at least $6 \\mathrm{~N}$ points, so we get the inequality $6 N \\leqslant 45+162$. From this, it follows that $N \\leqslant \\frac{207}{6}<35$ and $N \\leqslant 34$. Now let's provide an example for $N=34$. Number the teams from 1 to 15. We will show how teams from 1 to 6 can earn at least 34 points.\n\n- Suppose each team from 1 to 6 won against each team from 7 to 15, then each team from 1 to 6 earned $9 \\cdot 3=27$ points just from these games.\n- Suppose the teams from 1 to 6 played among themselves as indicated in the following table (in each cell, the number of points is shown that the team from the corresponding row received in the game with the team from the corresponding column):\n\n|  | $\\mathbf{1}$ | $\\mathbf{2}$ | $\\mathbf{3}$ | $\\mathbf{4}$ | $\\mathbf{5}$ | $\\mathbf{6}$ |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| $\\mathbf{1}$ |  | 3 | 3 | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n| $\\mathbf{2}$ | 0 |  | 3 | 3 | 1 | 0 |\n| $\\mathbf{3}$ | 0 | 0 |  | 3 | 3 | 1 |\n| $\\mathbf{4}$ | 1 | 0 | 0 |  | 3 | 3 |\n| $\\mathbf{5}$ | 3 | 1 | 0 | 0 |  | 3 |\n| $\\mathbf{6}$ | 3 | 3 | 1 | 0 | 0 |  |\n\n- Suppose in each game between teams from 7 to 15, the team with the higher number won (the outcome of these games does not matter).\n\nIn total, teams from 1 to 6 earned at least $27+7=34$ points.<|im_end|>\n"}

It remains to show that $x^{2}+7$ is not a sum of four (or less) squares of polynomials with rational coefficients. Suppose by way of contradiction that $x^{2}+7=f_{1}(x)^{2}+f_{2}(x)^{2}+f_{3}(x)^{2}+f_{4}(x)^{2}$, where the coefficients of polynomials $f_{1}, f_{2}, f_{3}$ and $f_{4}$ are rational (some of these polynomials may be zero). Clearly, the degrees of $f_{1}, f_{2}, f_{3}$ and $f_{4}$ are at most 1. Thus $f_{i}(x)=a_{i} x+b_{i}$ for $i=1,2,3,4$ and some rationals $a_{1}, b_{1}, a_{2}, b_{2}, a_{3}, b_{3}, a_{4}, b_{4}$.

We will show that such a solution does not exist. Assume the contrary and consider a solution with minimal $m$. Note that if an integer $x$ is odd then $x^{2} \\equiv 1(\\bmod 8)$. Otherwise (i.e., if $x$ is even) we have $x^{2} \\equiv 0(\\bmod 8)$ or $x^{2} \\equiv 4$ $(\\bmod 8)$. Hence, by (i), we get that $x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}$ and $x_{4}$ are even.

Let the \\( k \\) consecutive positive integers be \\( a, a+1, a+2, \\ldots, a+(k-1) \\). The sum of these integers can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   a + (a+1) + (a+2) + \\cdots + (a+k-1)\n   \\]\n   This is an arithmetic series with the first term \\( a \\) and the last term \\( a+(k-1) \\).\n\n2. The sum of an arithmetic series is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum} = \\frac{\\text{number of terms}}{2} \\times (\\text{first term} + \\text{last term})\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the sum of our series is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{k}{2} \\times (a + (a+k-1)) = \\frac{k}{2} \\times (2a + k - 1)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{k(2a + k - 1)}{2}\n   \\]\n\n3. We are given that this sum equals \\( 3^{11} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{k(2a + k - 1)}{2} = 3^{11}\n   \\]\n   Multiplying both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:\n   \\[\n   k(2a + k - 1) = 2 \\cdot 3^{11}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   k(2a + k - 1) = 2 \\cdot 3^{11}\n   \\]\n\n4. We need to find the largest possible value of \\( k \\). Notice that \\( k \\) must be a divisor of \\( 2 \\cdot 3^{11} \\). We will consider two cases: \\( k \\) is odd and \\( k \\) is even.\n\n5. **Case 1: \\( k \\) is odd**\n\n   If \\( k \\) is odd, then \\( k \\) must be a power of 3 because the only prime factor of \\( 3^{11} \\) is 3. The largest power of 3 less than or equal to \\( 3^{11} \\) is \\( 3^5 = 243 \\).\n\n6. **Case 2: \\( k \\) is even**\n\n   If \\( k \\) is even, let \\( k = 2p \\). Substituting \\( k = 2p \\) into the equation:\n   \\[\n   2p(2a + 2p - 1) = 2 \\cdot 3^{11}\n   \\]\n   Dividing both sides by 2:\n   \\[\n   p(2a + 2p - 1) = 3^{11}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( p \\) must be a power of 3. The largest power of 3 less than or equal to \\( 3^{11} \\) is \\( 3^5 = 243 \\). Therefore, \\( k = 2p = 2 \\cdot 243 = 486 \\).\n\n7.

The midpoints of adjacent sides of a rectangle with a perimeter of 32 were connected by segments.

How many times in total does one need to perform such an operation so that the perimeter of the resulting quadrilateral first becomes less than 1?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Geometry, Solution:Answer: 11.\n\nSolution: After two operations, a quadrilateral is obtained, the sides of which are the midlines of triangles with bases parallel to the sides of the original rectangle. Therefore, this quadrilateral is a rectangle, and each of its sides is half the length of the corresponding side of the original rectangle. Thus, after 2 operations, the perimeter is halved. After 5 pairs of operations, the perimeter will decrease by a factor of $2^{5}=32$ and will become equal to 1. From the triangle inequality, it is clear that the perimeter decreases with each operation. Therefore, after 11 operations, the perimeter will be less than 1.\n\n![](https:\/\/cdn.mathpix.com\/cropped\/2024_05_06_8687bd1ddeb4733a341eg-1.jpg?height=229&width=368&top_left_y=1413&top_left_x=1598)\n\nComment: A specific case is considered (for example, calculations are performed for a rectangle with sides given by specific numbers), but the method of calculations can be applied to any rectangle - 4 points; the method is applicable only to rectangles of a certain type - 1-2 points. If the first two operations were not taken into account when counting the number of operations, deduct 1 point.

Since \\(\\frac{F_{n-1} (F_{n+2} - 1)}{F_{n}} \\leq F_{n+1}\\), it follows that \\(a_{0} + a_{1} + \\cdots + a_{n} \\geq \\frac{F_{n+2} - 1}{F_{n}}\\), with equality holding if and only if \\(a_{n} = 0\\) and \\(a_{n-1} = \\frac{1}{F_{n}}\\). We denote by \\(M_{n}\\) the required minimum in the general case. We shall prove by induction that \\(M_{n} = \\frac{F_{n+2} - 1}{F_{n}}\\). For \\(M_{1} = 1\\) and \\(M_{2} = 2\\) it is easy to show that the formula holds; hence the inductive basis is true. Suppose that \\(n > 2\\). The sequences \\(1, \\frac{a_{2}}{a_{1}}, \\ldots, \\frac{a_{n}}{a_{1}}\\) and \\(1, \\frac{a_{3}}{a_{2}}, \\ldots, \\frac{a_{n}}{a_{2}}\\) also satisfy the conditions of the problem. Hence we have \n\\[ a_{0} + \\cdots + a_{n} = a_{0} + a_{1} \\left(1 + \\frac{a_{2}}{a_{1}} + \\cdots + \\frac{a_{n}}{a_{1}}\\right) \\geq 1 + a_{1} M_{n-1} \\]\nand \n\\[ a_{0} + \\cdots + a_{n} = a_{0} + a_{1} + a_{2} \\left(1 + \\frac{a_{3}}{a_{2}} + \\cdots + \\frac{a_{n}}{a_{2}}\\right) \\geq 1 + a_{1} + a_{2} M_{n-2} \\]\nMultiplying the first inequality by \\(M_{n-2} - 1\\) and the second one by \\(M_{n-1}\\), adding the inequalities and using that \\(a_{1} + a_{2} \\geq 1\\), we obtain \\((M_{n-1} + M_{n-2} + 1)(a_{0} + \\cdots + a_{n}) \\geq M_{n-1} M_{n-2} + M_{n-1} + M_{n-2} + 1\\), so \n\\[ M_{n} \\geq \\frac{M_{n-1} M_{n-2} + M_{n-1} + M_{n-2} + 1}{M_{n-1} + M_{n-2} + 1} \\]\nSince \\(M_{n-1} = \\frac{F_{n+1} - 1}{F_{n-1}}\\) and \\(M_{n-2} = \\frac{F_{n} - 1}{F_{n-2}}\\), the above inequality easily yields \\(M_{n} \\geq \\frac{F_{n+2} - 1}{F_{n}}\\). However, we have shown above that equality can occur; hence \\(\\frac{F_{n+2} - 1}{F_{n}}\\) is indeed the required minimum.<|im_end|>\n"}

Since the mirror image of any lottery number (a positive integer not greater than 90) is also a lottery number, and the mirror images of different numbers are different, the mirror image of any lottery ticket is also a valid lottery ticket.\n\nA ticket and its mirror image are certainly different, because the sum of the numbers marked on them is $5 \\cdot 91=455=2 \\cdot 227+1$, which is an odd number. From the above decomposition of 455, it is also clear that in one of a ticket and its mirror image, the sum of the five marked numbers will be greater than 227.\n\nThe pairing according to the mirror image thus divides the possible $\\binom{90}{5}$ lottery tickets into two classes of equal size, such that in every member of one class, the sum of the five marked numbers is at least 228, while in every member of the other class, this sum is at most 227.

Their \"friendship\" was counted exactly once, as it was included in the sum by the person who arrived later than their friend. Therefore, after everyone has arrived, the sum of the numbers on the door will be equal to the total number of friendships between people. Similarly, each \"enmity\" will be counted exactly once by the person who left earlier. Therefore, after everyone has left, the sum of the numbers on the door will be increased by the total number of \"enmities.\" In total, the overall sum of the numbers on the door will be equal to the sum of the total number of friendships and enmities, which is precisely the number of pairs of people who arrived, i.e., $16 * 15 \/ 2 = 120$.\n\nCriteria: only answer - 0 points.<|im_end|>\n"}

Since $r=1$, we have $t=s$. Using Heron's formula:\n\n$$\ns=\\sqrt{s \\cdot(s-a) \\cdot(s-b) \\cdot(s-c)}\n$$\n\nwhich simplifies to\n\n$$\ns=(s-a)(s-b)(s-c) \\cdot(1) \\text{ Hence } 8 s=(2 s-2 a)(2 s-2 b)(2 s-2 c) \\cdot(2)\n$$\n\nSince $a, b, c$ are integers, $2 s$ is also an integer, and for example, $2 s-2 a$ has the same parity as $2 s$. The same can be said about every factor on the right side of (2). Considering that the left side of (2) is even, the factors on the right side must also be even, so the integers $x=s-a, y=s-b, z=s-c$ are all integers. Given that $s-a+s-b+s-c=s$, equation (1) becomes:\n\n$$\nx+y+z=x \\cdot y \\cdot z\n$$\n\nWe can assume that among $x, y, z$, $z$ is the largest, and then\n\n$$\nx+y+z \\leq 3 z \\cdot(4) H a\n$$\n\nIf $x, y, z$ were all at least 2, then $x \\cdot y \\cdot z \\geq 4 z .(5) From (3), (4), and (5), we get 3z \\geq 4z$, which is a contradiction for $z>0$. Therefore, at least one of $x, y, z$ must be 1. Assuming $x=1$, from (3) we get $1+y+z=y \\cdot z$, or $(y-1)(z-1)=2$. Since $y$ and $z$ are positive integers and $z \\geq y, y=2$ and $z=3$. Thus, $s=6$ and $a=5, b=4, c=3$.\n\nBy the converse of the Pythagorean theorem, the triangle is a right triangle, and by Thales' theorem, the radius of the circumscribed circle is half the length of the hypotenuse, which is $\\frac{5}{2}$.\n\nIt can be easily verified that the radius of the inscribed circle of a triangle with sides $3, 4, 5$ is indeed 1 unit.<|im_end|>\n"}

These lines form equilateral triangles with side length \\(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}\\).\n\n2. **Finding Intersections:**\n   To form equilateral triangles, we need to find the intersections of these lines. The horizontal lines \\( y = k \\) intersect with the slanted lines \\( y = \\sqrt{3}x + 2a \\) and \\( y = -\\sqrt{3}x + 2b \\).\n\n3. **Intersection Points:**\n   Consider the intersection of \\( y = \\sqrt{3}x + 2a \\) and \\( y = -\\sqrt{3}x + 2b \\):\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{3}x + 2a = -\\sqrt{3}x + 2b\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   2\\sqrt{3}x = 2b - 2a \\implies x = \\frac{b - a}{\\sqrt{3}}\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( x \\) back into one of the equations to find \\( y \\):\n   \\[\n   y = \\sqrt{3} \\left( \\frac{b - a}{\\sqrt{3}} \\right) + 2a = b + a\n   \\]\n   Thus, the intersection point is \\( \\left( \\frac{b - a}{\\sqrt{3}}, a + b \\right) \\).\n\n4. **Range of \\( y \\):**\n   The value of \\( y \\) must be within the range of the horizontal lines \\( y = k \\), which are from \\( k = -10 \\) to \\( k = 10 \\). Since the height of an equilateral triangle with side length \\(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}\\) is \\(1\\), the possible values of \\( y \\) for the vertices of the triangles must be between \\( -9 \\) and \\( 11 \\).\n\n5. **Counting the Intersections:**\n   We need to count the number of pairs \\((a, b)\\) such that \\( a + b \\) falls within the range \\([-9, 11]\\).\n\n   - For \\( y = 11 \\), \\( a \\) can range from \\( 10 \\) to \\( 1 \\), giving \\( 10 \\) possible pairs.\n   - For \\( y = 10 \\), \\( a \\) can range from \\( 10 \\) to \\( 0 \\), giving \\( 11 \\) possible pairs.\n   - This pattern continues until \\( y = 0 \\), where there are \\( 21 \\) possible pairs.\n   - Then, the number of pairs decreases symmetrically until \\( y = -9 \\), where there are \\( 12 \\) possible pairs.\n\n   Summing these, we get:\n   \\[\n   10 + 11 + 12 + \\ldots + 21 + \\ldots + 12 = 330\n   \\]\n\n6. **Triangles Facing Downward:**\n   The same logic applies for triangles facing downward, giving another \\( 330 \\) triangles.\n\n7. **Total Number of Triangles:**\n   The total number of equilateral triangles is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 330 = 660\n   \\]\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{660}\\)<|im_end|>\n"}

By the assumption of contradiction, \\( C_1, C_2, \\cdots, C_6 \\) have all played against each other.\nTeams \\( C_1 \\) and \\( C_2 \\) have each played 5 matches among the 6 teams \\( \\{C_1, C_2, \\cdots, C_6\\} \\).

By the assumption of contradiction, these 8 teams have all played against each other. This way, \\( D_1 \\) and \\( D_2 \\) have not played against 10 other teams. Since only 7 rounds have been played, there must be two teams \\( E_1 \\) and \\( E_2 \\) among the 10 other teams that have not played against each other.

Its subsequences are sequences of the form $a_{i}, a_{i+1}, \\ldots, a_{j}$ such that $1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant j \\leqslant n$. Two subsequences are equal if they have the same length and are composed of the same terms; in other words, the subsequences $a_{i}, a_{i+1}, \\ldots, a_{j}$ and $a_{u}, a_{u+1}, \\ldots, a_{v}$ are considered equal if and only if $j-i=v-u$ and $a_{i+k}=a_{u+k}$ for all integers $k$ such that $0 \\leqslant k \\leqslant j-i$. Finally, a subsequence $a_{i}, a_{i+1}, \\ldots, a_{j}$ is said to be palindromic if it reads the same way in both directions, that is, if $a_{i+k}=a_{j-k}$ for all integers $k$ such that $0 \\leqslant k \\leqslant j-i$.\n\nWhat is the largest number of distinct palindromic subsequences that such a sequence of length $n$ can contain?\n\n## \u00a7<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Combinatorics, Solution:Solution\n\nFirst, if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\\ldots=a_{n}=0$, all subsequences formed of $k$ consecutive zero terms are indeed palindromic subsequences, regardless of the integer $k \\leqslant n$. A sequence of length $n$ can therefore contain $n$ distinct palindromic subsequences.\n\nConversely, let us prove that it cannot contain more than $n$ distinct subsequences. To do this, given a palindromic subsequence $\\mathbf{a}=a_{i}, \\ldots, a_{j}$, we call the origin of $\\mathbf{a}$ the largest integer $s$ such that $\\mathbf{a}$ coincides with the subsequence $a_{s}, \\ldots, a_{s+j-i}$.\n\nWe then prove that any integer is the origin of at most one palindromic subsequence. Indeed, if $s$ is the origin of two palindromic subsequences $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{a}^{\\prime}$ of lengths $\\ell<\\ell^{\\prime}$ respectively, let $s^{\\prime}=s+\\ell^{\\prime}-\\ell$. Then, for any integer $k$ such that $0 \\leqslant k \\leqslant \\ell$, we observe that\n\n$$\na_{s^{\\prime}+k}=a_{s+\\ell^{\\prime}-\\ell+k}=a_{s+\\ell-k}=a_{s+k}\n$$\n\nThis means that the sequence $a_{s^{\\prime}}, \\ldots, a_{s^{\\prime}+\\ell}$ coincides with the sequence $\\mathbf{a}^{\\prime}$, which contradicts the fact that $s$ is the origin of $\\mathbf{a}^{\\prime}$. Therefore, the sequence $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n}$ contains at most $n$ palindromic subsequences.<|im_end|>\n"}

For larger $M$s, let's examine the choice $k=2$. We know that a number divided by 9 gives the same remainder as the sum of its digits. Thus,\n\n$$\n9 \\mid M-S(M), \\quad \\text { and } \\quad 9 \\mid 2 M-S(2 M)\n$$\n\nfrom which, by taking their difference,\n\n$$\n9 \\mid(2 M-S(2 M)-(M-S(M))=M-S(2 M)+S(M)=M\n$$\n\nThe condition of the problem can therefore only be satisfied for numbers divisible by 9, apart from 1.\n\nSuppose $M$ is an $n$-digit number that satisfies the condition of the problem:\n\n$$\n10^{n-1} \\leqq MM \\geqq 10^{n}-a \\geqq 10^{n}-9\n$$\n\nonly one number divisible by 9 can fall into this range: $10^{n}-1$, which is the number written with $n$ nines. ($n$ is any positive integer.)\n\nWe will show that numbers of this form fit. Let $M=10^{n}-1$ and $2 \\leqq k \\leqq M$. Then\n\n$$\nk M=(k-1) 10^{n}+10^{n}-k=(k-1) 10^{n}+\\left(10^{n}-1\\right)-(k-1)\n$$\n\nHere, the first term ends with $n$ zeros, the second is the number written with $n$ nines, and the subtrahend is at most $n$-digit. Thus, the sum of the digits is again the sum of the sum of the digits of the first term and the difference. The sum of the digits of the first term is $S(k-1)$, and in forming the difference, each digit of $k-1$ must be subtracted from 9, so no carrying occurs. Thus, the sum of the digits of the difference is $9 n-S(k-1)$. The sum of the digits of $k M$ is therefore $9 n$, which is equal to $S(M)$. This is what we wanted to show.\n\nII. solution. From the previous solution, we take over that only numbers divisible by 9 come into question, and that the numbers 1 and of the form $10^{n}-1$ fit. Relying on these, we will see that these already give all the suitable numbers.\n\nLet $M$ be a number greater than 1 that fits. Let $n$ be the positive integer for which $\\left(10^{n}-1\\right) \/ 9 \\leqq M<$ $\\left(10^{n+1}-1\\right) \/ 9$. Choosing the lower bound for $k$\n\n$$\nS(k M)=S\\left((M \/ 9)\\left(10^{n}-1\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nHere, $M \/ 9<\\left(10^{n+1}-1\\right) \/ 81<\\left(10^{n}-1\\right)$. Since $\\left(10^{n}-1\\right)$ fits the condition of the problem,\n\n$$\nS\\left(\\frac{M}{9}\\left(10^{n}-1\\right)=S\\left(10^{n}-1\\right)=9 n\\right.\n$$\n\nIf $M$ is $n$-digit, then this can only match $S(M)$ if $M$ is the number written with $n$ nines, $10^{n}-1$. If $M$ is $(n+1)$-digit, then its first digit can only be 1 and the rest of its digits must be 0, because it is smaller than the number written with all ones. In this case, however, its sum of digits would be at most $1+9(n-1)<9 n$. Therefore, indeed only the numbers mentioned fit the condition.\n\nThis is the solution by Tam\u00e1s Fleiner.\n\nRemarks: 1. In the same way, it follows for any base $b$ number system that the numbers 1 and those written with all $(b-1)$ digits have the desired property.\n\n2. We saw that numbers not divisible by 9 do not satisfy the desired equality even for $k=2$. However, it does not seem to be an easy question to determine the smallest $k$ for which this happens for a number divisible by 9. The second solution shows this for a somewhat larger $k$ than the first. However, a \"bad\" $k$ value can be found for many numbers, which is much smaller than the one provided by the first solution. For example, 2 is such a $k$ for 324, 3 for 126, 4 for 117, 5 for $351$, 6 for 189, but for $198$, the first solution provided 101 as the smallest $k$ value.

It has five digits, all different, and is divisible by 111 . If he removes the middle digit and replaces it at the end, the result is a larger number that is still divisible by 111.

Since it is given that $\\overline{a b d e c}>\\overline{a b c d e}, \\overline{c d e} \\leq \\overline{d e c}-333$.\n\nHowever, we could have done the above logic with $d, e, c$ instead of $c, d, e$ and gotten $\\overline{d e c} \\leq \\overline{e c d}-333$. Consequently $\\overline{c d e} \\leq \\overline{e c d}-666$. Since obviously $\\overline{e c d} \\leq 999, \\overline{c d e}$ is one of the multiples of 37 up to 333:\n\n$$\n000037074111148185222259296333\n$$\n\nWe can immediately eliminate $000,111,222$, and 333 , since we know that the digits are all different. We can also eliminate 074, 185, and 296, since $\\overline{e c d}>\\overline{d e c}$. The three remaining choices are all of the form $111 \\cdot k+37$. So\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n11 \\mid \\overline{a b c d e} & \\\\\n& =\\overline{a b 000}+\\overline{c d e} \\\\\n& =999 \\cdot \\overline{a b}+\\overline{a b}+111 \\cdot k+37 \\\\\n11 \\mid \\overline{a b}+37 &\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhence $\\overline{a b}=74$.

There are $17$ rounds, so that each pair of teams play each other exactly once. After $n$ rounds, there always exists $4$ teams such that there was exactly one match played between these teams in those $n$ rounds. Find the maximum value of $n$.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Combinatorics, Solution:1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   We have 18 teams, and in each round, they are divided into 9 pairs to play 9 matches. There are 17 rounds in total, and each pair of teams plays exactly once. We need to find the maximum value of \\( n \\) such that after \\( n \\) rounds, there always exist 4 teams with exactly one match played between them.\n\n2. **Graph Representation:**\n   Represent the teams as vertices of a graph \\( G \\) with 18 vertices. Each match corresponds to an edge between two vertices. After 17 rounds, the graph \\( G \\) is a complete graph \\( K_{18} \\).\n\n3. **Subgraph Analysis:**\n   We need to find the maximum \\( n \\) such that in the graph formed after \\( n \\) rounds, there always exists a subset of 4 vertices with exactly one edge among them. This is equivalent to finding a subgraph \\( R \\subset G \\) with \\( |R| = 4 \\) and exactly one edge.\n\n4. **Case for \\( n = 7 \\):**\n   - Consider the largest group \\( G \\) of people, none of whom have played each other. By Zarankiewicz's Lemma, \\( |G| \\ge 3 \\).\n   - Suppose \\( |G| = k \\). If there exists another person not in \\( G \\) who played with at most \\( k-2 \\) people in \\( G \\), we win.\n   - Since everyone else must play someone in \\( G \\) (else we could add that person to expand \\( G \\)), there are at most \\( \\frac{k \\cdot 7}{k-1} \\) other people.\n   - Therefore, \\( k + \\frac{7k}{k-1} \\ge 18 \\), which simplifies to \\( k \\ge 10 \\). This is absurd because nobody can have played with 9 people already.\n   - Hence, \\( n = 7 \\) works.\n\n5. **Case for \\( n > 7 \\):**\n   - For \\( n = 8 \\), label the teams \\( A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_9 \\) and \\( B_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_9 \\). On day \\( i \\), \\( A_x \\) plays \\( B_{x+i} \\) for \\( 1 \\le x \\le 8 \\), with indices modulo 9.\n   - Check that no four people have exactly one match between them. This is easy to verify.\n   - For \\( n = 9 \\), consider the complement of the graph for \\( n = 8 \\). Any four people will have played at least two matches between them.\n   - For \\( n \\ge 10 \\), adding match days to the graph for \\( n = 9 \\) ensures any four people have played at least two matches between them.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - For \\( n \\ge 8 \\), it is impossible to find four teams with exactly one match between them.\n   - Therefore, the maximum value of \\( n \\) such that there always exist 4 teams with exactly one match played between them is \\( n = 7 \\).\n\nThe final answer is \\( n = \\boxed{7} \\)<|im_end|>\n"}

Let the length of the track be $\\mathrm{L}$, then the first meeting point of A and B, measured from the starting point in the direction of A's advance, is $\\frac{3}{5} \\mathrm{~L}$. When A completes the first lap, B has run $\\frac{2}{3} L$. After B runs the remaining $\\frac{1}{3} L$, A has turned back and is running at a speed of $\\mathrm{a}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{3}\\right)=\\frac{4}{3} \\mathrm{a}$. By the time B completes the first lap, A has turned back and run $\\frac{2}{3} L$, at which point B turns back and runs at a speed of $\\frac{2}{3} \\mathrm{a}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{5}\\right)=\\frac{4}{5} \\mathrm{a}$. From this point on, the speed ratio of A to B is $\\frac{4}{3} \\mathrm{a} \\div \\frac{4}{5} \\mathrm{a}=\\frac{5}{3}$, or $5: 3$. Therefore, at the second meeting, A has run $\\frac{5}{8}$ of the remaining $\\frac{L}{3}$, and B has run $\\frac{3}{8}$ of it, meaning the second meeting point is $\\frac{3}{8} \\times \\frac{L}{3} = \\frac{L}{8}$ from the starting point.

Then, by taking the difference of the two factors, we deduce that $d$ divides $2^{x+1}$. However, we know that each factor is a power of 3. Therefore, the smallest factor is 1. So $z-2^{x}=1$ which means $z=2^{x}+1$. Substituting $\\mathbf{z}$ into the previous equation, we get $2^{x+1}+1=3^{y}$. $(x=0, y=1, z=2)$ is a solution. We now focus on solutions with $x \\geq 1$.

Therefore $n$ is divisible by some prime that is $2 \\bmod 3$. In this case, the divisors of $n$ are equally likely to be 1 or $2 \\bmod 3$, so the sum is\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{2} \\tau(n)+d \\tau(n)=\\frac{2 d-1}{2} \\tau(n) .\n$$\n\nNow, $2 \\cdot 166=2^{2} \\cdot 83$ and 83 is prime, so we must either have $d=42$, which forces $\\tau(n)=4$, or $d=1$, which forces $\\tau(n)=332$. The first cases yields a lower value of $N$, namely $3^{42} 2^{3}$.\nNow let's try to compute this mod 1000 . This is clearly divisible by 8 .

Lines $C_{1} Y$ and $Z X$ lie in parallel planes $B B_{1} C_{1} C$ and $A A_{1} D_{1} D$, so they do not intersect. Since these two lines also lie in the same plane $C_{1} X Z Y$, they are parallel. Similarly, lines $Y Z$ and $C_{1} X$ are parallel. Therefore, quadrilateral $C_{1} X Z Y$ is a parallelogram.\n\n![](https:\/\/cdn.mathpix.com\/cropped\/2024_05_06_0323bbf84409a1adeb34g-46.jpg?height=504&width=680&top_left_y=1143&top_left_x=385)\n\nFig. 15: to the solution of problem 11.8\n\nLet us lay off segment $A T$ on $A D$, equal to $B Y$ (Fig. 15). Quadrilateral $B Y T A$ is a parallelogram, meaning segments $Y T, B A$, and $C_{1} D_{1}$ are parallel and equal. Additionally, segments $Y Z$ and $C_{1} X$ are parallel and equal; from the parallelism follows the equality of angles $Z Y T$ and $X C_{1} D_{1}$, which gives the equality of triangles $Z Y T$ and $X C_{1} D_{1}$.\n\nThen\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nD Z & =Z T+A D-A T=X D_{1}+B_{1} C_{1}-B Y= \\\\\n& =\\left(A_{1} D_{1}-A_{1} X\\right)+B_{1} C_{1}-B Y=(14-5)+14-3=20\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAnother solution. As in the previous solution, we will use the fact that $C_{1} X Z Y$ is a parallelogram.\n\nConsider the chain of vector equalities:\n\n$$\n\\overrightarrow{D Z}=\\overrightarrow{D C}+\\overrightarrow{C Y}+\\overrightarrow{Y Z}=\\overrightarrow{D_{1} C_{1}}+\\overrightarrow{C Y}+\\overrightarrow{C_{1} X}=\\overrightarrow{C Y}+\\overrightarrow{D_{1} X}\n$$\n\nIn the last part, all vectors are oriented the same as $\\overrightarrow{D Z}$, so we can transition to the equality of segments and continue:\n\n$$\nD Z=C Y+D_{1} X=(C B-B Y)+\\left(D_{1} A_{1}-A_{1} X\\right)=2 B_{1} C_{1}-B Y-A_{1} X\n$$\n\nSubstituting the lengths given in the condition, we get $D Z=2 \\cdot 14-3-5=20$.<|im_end|>\n"}

(20 points) In the Martian calendar, a year consists of 5882 days, and each month has either 100 or 77 days. How many months are there in the Martian calendar?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Number Theory, Solution:Answer: 74.\n\nSolution: Let $x$ be the number of months with 100 days, and $y$ be the number of months with 77 days. According to the problem, $100 x + 77 y = 5882$. It is obvious that $y \\leqslant 66$, otherwise $x < 0$. Notice that\n\n$$\nx \\bmod 11 = 100 x \\quad \\bmod 11 = 5882 \\quad \\bmod 11 = 8\n$$\n\nThus, $x = 11 k + 8$ for some integer $k$, from which we have\n\n$$\n(11 k + 8) \\cdot 100 + 77 y = 5882 \\Longleftrightarrow 1100 k = 5082 - 77 y = 77(66 - y)\n$$\n\nThe right side is divisible by 100, but 77 and 100 are coprime. Therefore, the number $66 - y$, which lies between 0 and 65, must be divisible by 100. This is only possible when $y = 66$. Therefore, $x = 0.01 \\cdot (5882 - 76 \\cdot 66) = 8$ and $x + y = 74$.<|im_end|>\n"}

To ensure that the connection is maintained even when any two nodes fail, it is necessary that at least three lines of communication enter each node (if node $A$ is connected to two nodes $B$ and $C$, then when nodes $B$ and $C$ fail, node $A$ becomes inaccessible).

Let $O=(0,0), Q=(13,4), A=(a, a), B=(b, 0)$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive real numbers with $b \\geq a$.

For how many of these line segments are $a$ and $b$ both integers?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Geometry, Solution:Solution:\n(a) For $Q$ to be the midpoint of $A B$ we have $(a+b) \/ 2=13$ and $(a+0) \/ 2=4$. The second equation means that $a=8$, which we can substitute into the first equation to get $b=18$.\n(b) When $O A B$ is isosceles, there are 3 possibilities: $O A=O B, O A=A B, O B=A B$.\nWhen $O B=A B$ we have a right angled triangle with a right angle at $b$, which would mean $a=b$. For the point $Q$ to be on this line, we must have $a=b=13$.\nWhen $O A=A B$, we have a right angled triangle at $A$. By symmetry we have $b=2 a$. So we need the point $(13,4)$ to be on the line through $(a, a)$ and $(2 a, 0)$. This is the line $x+y=2 a$ and since $(13,4)$ is on the line, we have $a=8.5, b=17$.\nWhen $O A=O B$ the triangle is not right-angled.\n(c) The slope of the line segment $A Q$ is $\\frac{4-a}{13-a}$ and the slope of the line segment $Q B$ is $\\frac{0-4}{b-13}$. These two line segments have the same slope, so we have that:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{-4}{b-13} & =\\frac{4-a}{13-a} \\\\\n52-4 a & =a b-4 b-13 a+52 \\\\\n0 & =a b-9 a-4 b \\\\\n36 & =(a-4)(b-9)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFor $a$ and $b$ to be positive integers, each of $a-4$ and $b-9$ must be positive divisors of 36. There are 9 possibilities:\n\\begin{tabular}{cccc}\n$\\mathrm{a}-4$ & $\\mathrm{~b}-9$ & $\\mathrm{a}$ & $\\mathrm{b}$ \\\\\n1 & 36 & 5 & 45 \\\\\n2 & 18 & 6 & 27 \\\\\n3 & 12 & 7 & 21 \\\\\n4 & 9 & 8 & 18 \\\\\n6 & 6 & 10 & 15 \\\\\n9 & 4 & 13 & 13 \\\\\n12 & 3 & 16 & 12 \\\\\n18 & 2 & 22 & 11 \\\\\n36 & 1 & 40 & 10\n\\end{tabular}\n\nSince $b \\geq a$ this excludes the last 3 cases, so there are 6 such line segments $A B$.<|im_end|>\n"}

Since 3 is a prime number, this is only possible if $a$ is divisible by 3.\n\nThe right side of the equation must be divisible by 2 and 5, which is similarly only possible if $b$ is divisible by 2 and 5.\n\nTherefore, there exist natural numbers $a_{1}$ and $b_{1}$ such that $a=3 a_{1}$ and $b=10 b_{1}$.\n\n1 point\n\nNotice that $a$ and $b$ are the smallest possible when $a_{1}$ and $b_{1}$ are the smallest possible. Substituting into the initial equation, we get\n\n$$\n3^{3} a_{1}^{4}=2^{2} \\cdot 5 b_{1}^{3}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, we conclude that $a_{1}$ must be divisible by 2 and 5, and $b_{1}$ must be divisible by 3. Therefore, $a_{1}=10 a_{2}$ and $b_{1}=3 b_{2}$, for some $a_{2}, b_{2} \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nAgain, we seek the smallest possible $a_{2}$ and $b_{2}$. The equation now becomes\n\n$$\n2^{2} \\cdot 5^{3} a_{2}^{4}=b_{2}^{3}\n$$\n\nWe conclude that $b_{2}=10 \\cdot b_{3}$, for some $b_{3} \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nFrom the following equation $a_{2}^{4}=2 b_{2}^{3}$, we conclude that $a_{2}$ is of the form $2 a_{3}\\left(a_{3} \\in \\mathbb{N}\\right)$, and from the new equation $2^{3} a_{3}^{4}=b_{3}^{3}$, we conclude that $b_{3}$ is of the form $2 b_{4}\\left(b_{4} \\in \\mathbb{N}\\right)$. Finally, we get the equation $a_{3}^{4}=b_{4}^{3}$, whose smallest solution in natural numbers is $a_{3}=b_{4}=1$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest natural number $m$ is\n\n$$\nm=50 a^{4}=50 \\cdot\\left(2^{2} \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5\\right)^{4}=2^{9} \\cdot 3^{4} \\cdot 5^{6}=648000000\n$$<|im_end|>\n"}

Each sauna can be used by either men only, or women only (but there is no limit on the number of people using a sauna at once, as long as they are of a single gender). Each woman is only willing to share a sauna with women whom she knows, and each man is only willing to share a sauna with men whom he does not know.

The case involves 80 people, one of whom is the criminal, and another is a witness to the crime (but it is unknown who they are). Each day, the detective can invite one or several of these 80 people, and if the witness is among the invited but the criminal is not, the witness will reveal who the criminal is. Can the detective definitely solve the case in 12 days?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Logic and Puzzles, Solution:The first method. We will number the 80 suspects with four-digit ternary numbers $\\overline{a b c d}$ from 0001 to 2222 (there are exactly $3^{4}-1=80$ such numbers).\n\nOn the $k$-th day ($k=1,2, \\ldots, 12$), Nero Wolfe invites those suspects whose numbers satisfy the $k$-th of the equalities $a=0, a=1, a=2$,\n\n$b=0, b=1, b=2, c=0, c=1, c=2, d=0, d=1, d=2$. Then, on one of these days, he will invite the witness, but not the criminal, since their numbers differ in at least one digit.\n\nThe second method. We will divide the suspects into 16 groups of 5 people each. We will number the groups with four-digit binary numbers $\\overline{a b c d}$ from 0000 to 1111, and we will number the members of each group from 1 to 5.\n\nOn the $k$-th day ($k=1,2, \\ldots, 8$), Nero Wolfe invites suspects from groups whose numbers satisfy the $k$-th of the equalities: $a=0, a=1$,\n\n$b=0, b=1, c=0, c=1, d=0, d=1$. If the criminal and the witness are in different groups, the crime will be solved on one of these days.\n\nSuppose the witness is in the same group as the criminal. Let $m$ and $n$ be the numbers of the witness and the criminal in this group, respectively. On the 9th day, Nero Wolfe invites suspects with numbers 1 and 2 from each group, on the 10th day - suspects with numbers 3 and 4, on the 11th day - suspects with numbers 1, 3, and 5, and on the 12th day - suspects with numbers 2, 4, and 5. Then, there will be one of these days when suspects with number $m$ are invited from each group, but suspects with number $n$ are not invited. This means that on this day, the crime will be solved.\n\nThe third method. We will show that Nero Wolfe can find the criminal even in 9 days. For this, we will assign each suspect a number - a nine-digit binary number, four digits of which are ones, and five are zeros (this is possible since there are $C_{9}^{4}=126$ such numbers).\n\nOn the $k$-th day ($k=1,2, \\ldots, 9$), Nero Wolfe invites those suspects whose $k$-th digit of the number is 1. Since all numbers contain exactly 4 ones, there will be a number $m$ from 1 to 9 such that the witness has a 1 in the $m$-th place, and the criminal has a 0. This means that on the $m$-th day, the witness will be invited to Nero Wolfe without the criminal, and the crime will be solved.\n\n## Answer\n\nYes.<|im_end|>\n"}

For example, the smallest three oneic numbers are $1$, $11$, and $111$. Find the number of $1$'s in the smallest oneic number that is divisible by $63$.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Number Theory, Solution:To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest oneic number (a number consisting only of the digit 1) that is divisible by 63. Since 63 can be factored into \\(63 = 7 \\times 9\\), the oneic number must be divisible by both 7 and 9.\n\n1. **Divisibility by 9**:\n   A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. Since a oneic number consists only of the digit 1, the sum of its digits is equal to the number of digits. Therefore, the number of 1's must be a multiple of 9.\n\n2. **Divisibility by 7**:\n   To check for divisibility by 7, we need to consider the properties of oneic numbers modulo 7.

This means:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{10^n - 1}{9} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   10^n - 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{63}\n   \\]\n   This implies:\n   \\[\n   10^n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{63}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Finding the smallest \\(n\\)**:\n   We need to find the smallest \\(n\\) such that \\(10^n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{63}\\). We can use the order of 10 modulo 63 to find this \\(n\\). The order of 10 modulo 63 is the smallest positive integer \\(d\\) such that \\(10^d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{63}\\).\n\n   By testing successive powers of 10 modulo 63, we find:\n   \\[\n   10^1 \\equiv 10 \\pmod{63}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   10^2 \\equiv 100 \\equiv 37 \\pmod{63}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   10^3 \\equiv 370 \\equiv 55 \\pmod{63}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   10^4 \\equiv 550 \\equiv 46 \\pmod{63}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   10^5 \\equiv 460 \\equiv 19 \\pmod{63}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   10^6 \\equiv 190 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{63}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the order of 10 modulo 63 is 6. This means the smallest \\(n\\) such that \\(10^n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{63}\\) is 6.\n\n4. **Combining the conditions**:\n   Since \\(n\\) must be a multiple of both 9 (for divisibility by 9) and 6 (for divisibility by 7), the smallest such \\(n\\) is the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 6:\n   \\[\n   \\text{LCM}(9, 6) = 18\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the smallest oneic number that is divisible by 63 has 18 ones.\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).<|im_end|>\n"}

Thus, the expression in question is divisible by 3.

Let the roots of the polynomial \\(x^3 + (4-i)x^2 + (2+5i)x = z\\) be \\(a+bi\\), \\(a-bi\\), and \\(c+di\\). Since two of the roots form a conjugate pair, we can denote them as \\(a+bi\\) and \\(a-bi\\), and the third root as \\(c+di\\).\n\n2. By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of the polynomial is equal to the negation of the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) divided by the leading coefficient. Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   (a+bi) + (a-bi) + (c+di) = - (4-i)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   2a + c + di = -4 + i\n   \\]\n   By comparing the real and imaginary parts, we obtain:\n   \\[\n   2a + c = -4 \\quad \\text{(1)}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   d = 1 \\quad \\text{(2)}\n   \\]\n\n3. Next, we consider the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time, which is equal to the coefficient of \\(x\\) divided by the leading coefficient.

Now, we need to find \\(z\\). The product of the roots taken three at a time is equal to \\(-z\\). Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   (a+bi)(a-bi)(c+di) = -z\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   (a^2 + b^2)(c+di) = -z\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\(a = \\frac{5}{2}\\), \\(b = \\frac{\\sqrt{163}}{2}\\), \\(c = -9\\), and \\(d = 1\\), we get:\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{163}}{2}\\right)^2\\right)(-9 + i) = -z\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{25}{4} + \\frac{163}{4}\\right)(-9 + i) = -z\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{188}{4}\\right)(-9 + i) = -z\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   47(-9 + i) = -z\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   -423 + 47i = -z\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   z = 423 - 47i\n   \\]\n\n7.

We can thus conjecture that $f(n)=n$ for all $n$, which we will prove by strong induction.\n\nInitialization: We have just shown that $f(1)=1, f(2)=2, f(3)=3$.\n\nInduction: Let $n \\geqslant 3$ such that $f(i)=i$ for all $i \\leqslant n$.\n\nThen $1+2+\\cdots+n+f(n+1) \\mid 1+2+\\ldots n+1$, so $\\left.\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}+f(n+1) \\right\\rvert\\, \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$.\n\nFor $n \\geqslant 3, \\frac{\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}}{\\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}}=\\frac{n}{n+2}=1-\\frac{2}{n+2}>\\frac{1}{2}$, so $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}+f(n+1)>\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}>$ $\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$. The only possible integer value for $\\frac{\\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}}{\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}+f(n+1)}$ is thus 1, or equivalently $f(n+$ $1)=n+1$, as desired.\n\nThus our induction holds, and $f(n)=n$ for all $n>0$.\n\n## 2 Pigeonhole Principle (Angela)\n\n## Intuitive Idea\n\nSuppose there are $n$ drawers and $n+1$ socks placed in these drawers. There is at least one drawer containing at least two socks.\n\nTheorem 1 (Pigeonhole Principle).\n\nMore generally, if $n$ elements must be placed in $k$ drawers, then there is at least one drawer that contains at least $\\left\\lceil\\frac{n}{k}\\right\\rceil$ elements.\n\nNote: $\\lceil x\\rceil$ denotes the ceiling function, i.e., the unique integer such that $x \\leqslant\\lceil x\\rceil<x+1$.\n\n## Example 2.\n\nHow many children are needed in a school to ensure that at least 3 of them have their birthday on the same day?\n\nIf there are 733 students, then by the pigeonhole principle, we are guaranteed to have at least three students who have the same birthday (there are 366 possible dates). This number is minimal because there exists a configuration with 732 students without having three students with the same birthday.\n\nThe pigeonhole principle is a very simple and intuitive concept, but its consequences can be quite impressive. This type of reasoning is particularly effective for problems requiring the proof of the existence of an element. Of course, one must know how to identify the drawers and the socks, which can be very challenging.<|im_end|>\n"}

The given numbers, arranged in ascending order, form an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 5. Therefore, the remainders when these numbers are divided by 3 alternate. Indeed, if one of these numbers is divisible by 3, i.e., has the form $3k$, where $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, then the next number is $3k+5=3(k+1)+2$ - and it gives a remainder of 2 when divided by 3, followed by $3k+10=3(k+3)+1$, which gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, and then $-3k+15$, which is again divisible by 3. Thus, the remainders when these numbers are divided by 3 follow the pattern $\\ldots 0 ; 2 ; 1 ; 0 ; 2 ; 1 ; 0 \\ldots$\n\nAmong the given numbers, there are 53 numbers that give a remainder of 1 when divided by 3 (they form the set $A=\\{10 ; 25 ; 40 ; \\ldots ; 790\\}$), 53 numbers that are divisible by 3 ($B=\\{15 ; 30 ; 45 ; \\ldots ; 795\\}$), and 54 numbers that give a remainder of 2 when divided by 3 ($C=\\{5 ; 20 ; 35 ; \\ldots ; 800\\}$).\n\nThe sum of three numbers can be divisible by 3 in the following cases.\n\n1) All three numbers give the same remainder when divided by 3. There are $C_{54}^{3}$ ways to choose 3 numbers from set $C$ and $C_{53}^{3}$ ways to choose 3 numbers from sets $A$ and $B$. In total, we get $\\frac{54 \\cdot 53 \\cdot 52}{6}+2 \\cdot \\frac{53 \\cdot 52 \\cdot 51}{6}=24804+2 \\cdot 23426=71656$ ways.\n2) If not all remainders are the same, the only suitable case is when all three remainders are different, i.e., we must choose one number from each of the sets $A, B, C$.

The $\\sigma_{1}, \\ldots, \\sigma_{n}$ are called the elementary symmetric functions of the $\\alpha_{i}$. Symmetric, because a permutation of the $\\alpha_{i}$ leaves the $\\sigma_{k}$ invariant. Elementary, because it can be shown that any symmetric expression in $n$ variables can be expressed polynomially using these elementary symmetric functions. More precisely, if $P\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right)$ is a polynomial in $n$ variables (the reader is left to imagine what this is) such that for any permutation $\\sigma$ of $\\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$ we have $P\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right)=P\\left(x_{\\sigma(1)}, \\ldots, x_{\\sigma(n)}\\right)$, then there exists a polynomial in $n$ variables $R$ such that $P\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right)=R\\left(\\alpha_{1}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{n}\\right)$.\n\nExample 3.38. Noting $\\alpha_{1}=x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}, \\alpha_{2}=x_{1} x_{2}+x_{1} x_{3}+x_{2} x_{3}$ and $\\alpha_{3}=x_{1} x_{2} x_{3}$, we have:\n\n$$\nx_{1}^{3}+x_{2}^{3}+x_{3}^{3}=\\alpha_{1}^{3}-3 \\alpha_{1} \\alpha_{2}+3 \\alpha_{3}\n$$\n\nIn short, when dealing with symmetric quantities, it can sometimes be judicious to involve the associated elementary symmetric functions.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Algebra, Solution:Suppose that $a x^{2}-(a+3) x+2=0$ has two roots of opposite sign, denoted by $z_{1}, z_{2}$. Then, according to Vieta's formulas, $z_{1} z_{2}=2 \/ a$. Now, $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$ are of opposite sign if and only if $z_{1} z_{2}<0$. We deduce that $a<0$. Conversely, if $a<0$, then the discriminant of the equation is $a^{2}-2 a+9$. To show that it is positive, we use the canonical form by writing $a^{2}-2 a+9=(a-1)^{2}+8 \\geqslant 0$. Thus, when $a<0$, there are two real solutions denoted by $z_{1}, z_{2}$. According to Vieta's formulas, $z_{1} z_{2}=2 \/ a<0$, so $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$ are of opposite sign.\n\nNote that in the proof of the converse, it was first necessary to show that the polynomial has two real roots before using Vieta's formulas.<|im_end|>\n"}

For $n=5$, we get that angle $A S B$ has a size of $\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot 360^{\\circ}=72^{\\circ}$, so angles $S A B, S B A$, etc., have a size of $\\frac{1}{2}\\left(180^{\\circ}-72^{\\circ}\\right)=54^{\\circ}$.\n\n![](https:\/\/cdn.mathpix.com\/cropped\/2024_04_17_e57040b3fafc3d67d9eag-4.jpg?height=597&width=631&top_left_y=1846&top_left_x=718)<|im_end|>\n"}

We know that if the prime factorization of a positive integer $n$ is $p_{1}^{\\alpha_{1}} \\cdot p_{2}^{\\alpha_{2}} \\cdots \\cdots p_{n}^{\\alpha_{n}}$, then the number of positive divisors of the number is: $d(n)=\\left(\\alpha_{1}+1\\right)\\left(\\alpha_{2}+1\\right) \\ldots\\left(\\alpha_{n}+1\\right)$.\n\nA number will have exactly 6 different divisors if it is either\na) of the form $p_{1}^{5}$, where $p_{1}$ is a prime number, or\nb) of the form $p_{1}^{2} \\cdot p_{2}$, where $p_{1}, p_{2}$ are different prime numbers.\n\nIf $p=2$, then $N=p^{2}+11=15=3 \\cdot 5$; it does not satisfy either condition, so $p$ must be an odd prime number.\n\nIf $p=3$, then $N=3^{2}+11=20=2^{2} \\cdot 5$ satisfies condition b); 20 indeed has 6 different positive divisors: $1,2,4,5,10$ and 20.\n\nIf $p$ is odd and not 3, then its square gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 4, since $p^{2}=(2 k+1)^{2}=4 k^{2}+4 k+1$. Therefore, $N=p^{2}+11$ is divisible by 4. If now $N=p_{1}^{5}$, then $p_{1}$ can only be 2, but from $p^{2}+11=32$ we do not get an integer value for $p$. Therefore, $N$ cannot be of the form $p_{1}^{5}$. Thus, $N$ must be of the form $p_{1}^{2} p_{2}$, and due to its divisibility by 4, $p_{1}=2$. But $N$ is also divisible by 3, since $p^{2}$ gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 3 (since $p$ is either of the form $3 l+1$ or $3 l-1$), so $p_{2}=3$. Thus, $N=p^{2}+11=2^{2} \\cdot 3=12$, and from this $p=1$, which is not a prime number.\n\nTherefore, the only solution to the problem is $p=3$.\n\nLajos G\u00e1thy (Feh\u00e9rgyarmat, Zalka M.

(GDR, 78). A circle is circumscribed around a regular $2 n$-gon.

What is the probability that a randomly chosen triplet of vertices will be one-sided?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Combinatorics, Solution:27.4. If two vertices out of three have already been chosen, the number of ways to choose the third vertex so that the resulting triplet is one-sided depends on the angular distance 1 between the two chosen vertices. (The angular distance between vertices $A$ and $B$ is defined as $l=\\widehat{A O B} \\cdot(n \/ \\pi)$, where $O$ is the center of the $2n$-gon; here, $l \\leqslant n$, and the angular distance between adjacent vertices is 1.) If $l < n$, the third vertex can be chosen in $(l-1) + 2(n-l) = 2n - 1 - l$ ways; if $l = n$, it can be chosen arbitrarily, i.e., in $2n - 2$ ways. Further, for each value of $l = 1, 2, \\ldots, n-1$, there are exactly $2n \\cdot 2 = 4n$ ways to choose the first and then the second vertex at an angular distance $l$ from the first. Finally, for $l = n$, there are only $2n$ such ways. Therefore, the total number of ways to sequentially choose three vertices is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& 4n \\cdot \\sum_{l=1}^{n-1}(2n-1-l) + 2n(2n-2) = \\\\\n& = 4n(2n-1)(n-1) - 4n \\frac{(n-1)n}{2} + 4n(n-1) = 6n^2(n-1)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe have calculated the number of one-sided triplets under the condition that in each triplet, the first, second, and third vertices are distinguished.

(10 points) On September 21, 2015, the Ministry of Education announced the list of national youth campus football characteristic schools. Xiao Xiao's school was on the list. To better prepare for the elementary school football league to be held in the city next year, the school's team will recently play a football friendly match with three other teams. The matches will be played in a round-robin format (i.e., each team will play one match against every other team). The rules are: 3 points for a win, 0 points for a loss, and 1 point for each team in a draw. The ranking will be determined by the total points, and if two teams have the same points, the goal difference, head-to-head results, and other factors will be considered to determine the ranking. To ensure that Xiao Xiao's school team finishes in the top two in this friendly match, they need to score at least $\\qquad$ points.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Combinatorics, Solution:\u3010Analysis\u3011It is easy to get the total number of matches in the group stage as the number of groups $\\times$ (number of groups -1$) \\div 2$, which can give the total points of 4 teams, and then we can discuss whether a team can advance with 6 points or 7 points.\n\n\u3010Solution\u3011Solution: 4 teams play a single round-robin tournament, which involves a total of $4 \\times 3 \\div 2=6$ matches. After each match, the total points of the two teams are either 2 points (a draw) or 3 points (a win and a loss). Therefore, the total points of all teams after 6 matches do not exceed 18 points.\n(1) If a team scores 7 points, the total points of the remaining 3 teams do not exceed 11 points. It is impossible for two teams to have a total score greater than or equal to 7 points, so this team must advance.\n(2) If a team scores 6 points, it is possible that two other teams also score 6 points, and their goal difference is better than this team, so this team may still not advance.\n\nIn summary, for the school team to secure a top-two finish in this friendly tournament, they need to score at least 7 points.

Later, many journals published the solution method using the discriminant for this problem, and then made a \"correction\" to the \"ingenious solution,\" the main reason being that the original equation is not a quadratic equation, and using the discriminant is completely wrong; the correct conclusion is only a \"coincidence.\" In fact, any expression can be completed by the method of completing the square when needed, and the result of completing the square in Example 2 is still\n$$\n\\text { . }\\left(x-\\sin \\frac{\\pi x}{2}\\right)^{2}=\\sin ^{2} \\frac{\\pi x}{2}-1 \\text {, }\n$$\n\nwhich is exactly $(2 a x+b)^{2}=b^{2}-4 a c$.\nMoreover, can't an equation that is not a quadratic equation be treated as a quadratic equation? Can't it be transformed into a quadratic equation? For example, let $k=\\sin \\frac{\\pi x}{2} \\in[-1,1]$, and then discuss the parameter $(|k| \\leqslant 1)$, and solve the equation. Isn't this something everyone is very familiar with?\nFor instance, let $x=a$ be a real root of the original equation, then\n$$\na^{2}-2 a \\sin \\frac{\\pi a}{2}+1=0 \\text {. }\n$$\n\nThis indicates that $x=a$ is a real root of the quadratic equation\n$$\nx^{2}-2 x \\sin \\frac{\\pi a}{2}+1=0\n$$\n\nAt this point, using the discriminant should not be a problem.\n$$\n\\Delta=4 \\sin ^{2} \\frac{\\pi a}{2}-4=4\\left(\\sin ^{2} \\frac{\\pi a}{2}-1\\right) \\geqslant 0,\n$$\n\nwhich means $\\sin ^{2} \\frac{\\pi a}{2} \\geqslant 1$.\nHowever, by the range of the sine function, we also have $\\sin ^{2} \\frac{\\pi a}{2} \\leqslant 1$.\nTherefore, $\\sin ^{2} \\frac{\\pi a}{2}=1$ (necessity).\nSubstituting into equation (7), we get $x^{2} \\pm 2 x+1=0$.\nSolving, we get $x= \\pm 1$.\nVerification shows that $x=a= \\pm 1$ satisfies both equation (7) and equation (8) (sufficiency), hence they are all the real roots of the original equation.\n\nThis treatment differs from the standard answer only in minor notational differences (introducing $a$). If the essence is understood, this difference is actually superfluous.\n\nFor this problem, although independently using the discriminant is reasonable, linking the discriminant with the completed square is simpler.\nSolution: From the given (i.e., equation (2))\n$$\n\\left(x-\\sin \\frac{\\pi x}{2}\\right)^{2}=\\sin ^{2} \\frac{\\pi x}{2}-1 \\text {. }\n$$\n\nBy the non-negativity of the square of a real number and the range of the sine function, we have $0 \\leqslant\\left(x-\\sin \\frac{\\pi x}{2}\\right)^{2}=\\sin ^{2} \\frac{\\pi x}{2}-1 \\leqslant 0$.\nThus, we have $\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}x=\\sin \\frac{\\pi x}{2}, \\\\ \\sin \\frac{\\pi x}{2}= \\pm 1 .\\end{array}\\right.$\nTherefore, $x=1,-1$ are all the real roots of the original equation.\n1.4 Recognizing closure, a solution method for constructing equations for a fill-in-the-blank problem.<|im_end|>\n"}

This can be factored as $(p-4)(p+1)=0$. Since 4 and -1 are not prime numbers, this does not yield any solutions.\n\nIn the other case, we have $p \\mid 2 q+3$ and $q \\mid p^{2}-p-1$. Since $2 q+3$ and $p^{2}-p-1$ are positive, it follows that $p \\leq 2 q+3$ and $q \\leq p^{2}-p-1$. To find a sharper lower bound for $p$, we multiply the two relations\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\np q & \\mid(2 q+3)\\left(p^{2}-p-1\\right) \\\\\n& \\mid 2 q p^{2}-2 q p-2 q+3\\left(p^{2}-p-1\\right) \\\\\n& \\mid 3\\left(p^{2}-p-1\\right)-2 q,\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere we have discarded terms with a factor of $p q$. Note now that $3\\left(p^{2}-p-1\\right)-2 q \\geq$ $3 q-2 q=q>0$. This means that the above divisibility relation leads to\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\np q & \\leq 3\\left(p^{2}-p-1\\right)-2 q \\\\\n& =3 p^{2}-3 p-(2 q+3) \\\\\n& \\leq 3 p^{2}-3 p-p \\\\\n& =3 p^{2}-4 p .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIf we move $4 p$ to the other side and divide by $p$, we find that $q+4 \\leq 3 p$, or\n\n$$\n\\frac{2 q+3}{6}<\\frac{q+4}{3} \\leq p\n$$\n\nSince $p$ is a divisor of $2 q+3$, we deduce that $2 q+3=k p$ with $k \\in\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$. If $k=1$, then we have $2 q+3=p$ and thus also $q=p^{2}-p-1$. But then it would hold that $p=2 q+3=2\\left(p^{2}-p-1\\right)+3=2 p^{2}-2 p+1$. This can be factored as $(2 p-1)(p-1)=0$, which has no solutions with $p$ prime. If $k=2$ or $k=4$, then $k p$ is even. But $2 q+3$ is odd, so these cases are ruled out. If $k=3$, then from $2 q+3=3 p$ it follows that $q$ must be a multiple of 3. Since $q$ is prime, we then have $q=3$, and thus also $p=(2 q+3) \/ 3=3$. Checking shows that this is not a solution to the original equation.\n\nThe last case is $k=5$. Then we have $5 p=2 q+3$ and from the original equation, we have $5 q=p^{2}-p-1$. If we substitute this, we get $25 p=5(2 q+3)=$ $2\\left(p^{2}-p-1\\right)+15=2 p^{2}-2 p+13$. This can be factored as $(p-13)(2 p-1)=0$. This gives the possible solution $p=13$ with $q=(5 p-3) \/ 2=31$. We check that $(p, q)=(13,31)$ is indeed a solution to the problem.<|im_end|>\n"}

Let the area of the circle between the chords $A B$ and $C D$ be $x \\mathrm{~m}^{2}$.\n\nSince the tank is a cylinder which is lying on a flat surface, the volume of water added can be viewed as an irregular prism with base of area $x \\mathrm{~m}^{2}$ and length $30 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nThus, the volume of water equals $30 x \\mathrm{~m}^{3}$.

Then each person in the $k$-th group has $45-k$ acquaintances.\n\nUnder this condition, the problem is solved, and the total number of pairs of acquaintances is\n\n$C_{45}^{2}-\\left(C_{2}^{2}+C_{3}^{2}+\\ldots+C_{9}^{2}\\right)=870$\n\nWe will prove that there could not have been a greater number of acquaintances. Fix some $k, 0 \\leq k \\leq 44$. Suppose some graduate knows exactly $k$ others. By the condition, none of his acquaintances can have exactly $k$ acquaintances.

To achieve this, we can place the black balls with at least one white ball between each pair.\n   - Consider the arrangement of black balls as follows: B _ B _ B _ B _ B. Here, the underscores represent the positions where white balls can be placed to ensure no two black balls are adjacent.\n\n2. **Counting the Positions for White Balls:**\n   - There are 6 positions (underscores) where we can place the white balls: one before the first black ball, four between the black balls, and one after the last black ball.\n   - We have 7 white balls in total, and 4 of them are already used to separate the black balls. Therefore, we have 3 white balls left to place in these 6 positions.\n\n3. **Distributing the Remaining White Balls:**\n   - We need to distribute the remaining 3 white balls into the 6 available positions. This is a classic \"stars and bars\" problem where we need to find the number of ways to distribute \\(n\\) indistinguishable items (white balls) into \\(k\\) distinguishable bins (positions).\n\n4. **Using the Stars and Bars Theorem:**\n   - The number of ways to distribute \\(n\\) indistinguishable items into \\(k\\) distinguishable bins is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k-1}\\).\n   - Here, \\(n = 3\\) (remaining white balls) and \\(k = 6\\) (positions), so we need to calculate \\(\\binom{3+6-1}{6-1} = \\binom{8}{5}\\).\n\n5. **Calculating the Binomial Coefficient:**\n   \\[\n   \\binom{8}{5} = \\binom{8}{3} = \\frac{8!}{3!(8-3)!} = \\frac{8!}{3!5!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 56\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of ways to arrange seven white and five black balls in a line such that no two black balls are adjacent is \\(56\\).\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{56}\\).<|im_end|>\n"}

We represent each person by a point. There are six possible pairs of friends: $A B, A C, A D, B C, B D$, and $C D$. We represent a friendship by joining the corresponding pair of points and a non-friendship by not joining the pair of points.\n\nSince each pair of points is either joined or not joined and there are 6 possible pairs, then there are $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2=2^{6}=64$ possible configurations of line segments in the diagram.

In other words, points $A$ and $B$ are connected if we can pass from $A$ to $B$ along line segments, possibly through one or both of $C$ and $D$.\n\nIf each pair of points is connected, we call the configuration fully connected.\n\nThus, we need to count the number of configurations that are fully connected.\n\nFirst, we count the number of configurations including each possible number of line segments ( 0 through 6). After this, we will analyze each case to see which configurations are fully connected.\n\n- 0 line segments: There is 1 such configuration.\n- 6 line segments: There is 1 such configuration.\n- 1 line segment: There are 6 such configurations, because we can choose any one of the 6 possible segments.\n- 5 line segments: There are 6 such configurations, because we can start with all 6 line segments and remove any one of the 6 possible segments.\n- 2 line segments: There are 15 such configurations. This is because there are 6 possible choices for the first line segment to add, and then 5 possible choices for the second line segment. This looks like $6 \\times 5$ configurations, but each configuration is counted twice here (as we could choose $A B$ and then $B D$ or $B D$ and then $A B$ ). Therefore, there are $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 \\times 5=15$ configurations.\n- 4 line segments: There are 15 such configurations, because we can start with all 6 line segments and remove any of the 15 possible pairs of 2 line segments.\n- 3 line segments: There are 20 configurations, because there are 64 configurations in total and we have already accounted for $1+1+6+6+15+15=44$ configurations.\n\nHere is an example of each of these types of configurations:\n\n![](https:\/\/cdn.mathpix.com\/cropped\/2024_04_20_faa9db06d997f2a5b9b1g-123.jpg?height=298&width=1678&top_left_y=510&top_left_x=275)\n\n6 segments\n5 segments\n4 segments\n3 segments\n2 segments\n1 segment 0 segments\n\nNow we analyze each of the possible classes of configurations to see if the relevant configurations are fully connected or not:\n\n- 0 line segments\n\nThis configuration is not fully connected.\n\n-6 line segments\n\nThis configuration is fully connected.\n\n- 1 line segment\n\nEach of these 6 configurations is not fully connected, since it can only have 2 points joined.\n\n-5 line segments\n\nEach of these 6 configurations is fully connected, since only one pair of points is not joined. If this pair is $A B$, for instance, then $A$ and $B$ are each joined to $C$, so the configuration is fully connected. (See the diagram labelled \"5 segments\" above.) The same is true no matter which pair is not joined.\n\n-2 line segments\n\nEach of these 15 configurations is not fully connected, since the two line segments can only include 3 points with the fourth point not connected to any other point (for example, $B$ connected to each of $A$ and $C$ ) or two pairs of connected points (as in the diagram labelled \"2 segments\" above).\n\n-4 line segments\n\nEach of these 15 configurations is fully connected.\n\nConsider starting with all 6 pairs of points joined, and then remove two line segments.\n\nThere are two possibilities: either the two line segments share an endpoint, or they do not.\n\nAn example of the first possibility is removing $A B$ and $B C$ to get Figure 1. This configuration is fully connected, and is representative of this subcase.\n\nAn example of the second possibility is removing $A B$ and $C D$ to get Figure 2.

We cannot have $A C$ and $A D$ both joined, or $B C$ and $B D$ both joined, since we cannot have 3 segments coming from the same point.\n\nAlso, we cannot have $A C$ and $B C$ both joined, or $A D$ and $B D$\n\n![](https:\/\/cdn.mathpix.com\/cropped\/2024_04_20_faa9db06d997f2a5b9b1g-124.jpg?height=212&width=217&top_left_y=1607&top_left_x=1694)\nboth joined, since we cannot include just 3 points.\n\nTherefore, we must have $A C$ and $B D$ joined, or $A D$ and $B C$ joined.

What is the average age of the inhabitants of Campo Verde?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Algebra, Solution:If $H$ denotes the number of men and $M$ the number of women, then $H \/ M=2 \/ 3$, so that $M=(3 H) \/ 2$ and, therefore, the population of Campo Verde is given by\n\n$$\nH+M=H+\\frac{3}{2} H=\\frac{5}{2} H\n$$\n\nIf the average age of men is 37 years, then\n\n$$\n37=\\text { average age of } H \\text { men }=\\frac{\\text { sum of the ages of all men }}{H}\n$$\n\nso that $37H$ is the sum of the ages of all men. Similarly, $42M$ is the sum of the ages of all women. It follows that the sum of the ages of the entire population is given by\n\n$$\n37 H+42 M=37 H+42 \\frac{3}{2} H=100 H\n$$\n\nThus, the average age of the population of Campo Verde is\n\n$$\n\\frac{37 H+42 M}{H+M}=\\frac{100 H}{\\frac{5 H}{2}}=\\frac{100 \\times 2}{5}=40 \\text { years. }\n$$<|im_end|>\n"}

Determine the smallest possible value of $M(x, y)$ over all real numbers $x$ and $y$ with $0 \\leq x, y \\leq 1$.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Algebra, Solution:We show that the minimum value is $\\frac{4}{9}$. This value can be achieved by taking $x=y=\\frac{2}{3}$. Then we have $x y=\\frac{4}{9}, (x-1)(y-1)=\\frac{1}{9}$, and $x+y-2 x y=\\frac{4}{9}$, so the maximum is indeed $\\frac{4}{9}$.\n\nNow we will prove that $M(x, y) \\geq \\frac{4}{9}$ for all $x$ and $y$. Let $a=x y, b=(x-1)(y-1)$, and $c=x+y-2 x y$. If we replace $x$ and $y$ with $1-x$ and $1-y$, then $a$ and $b$ are swapped and $c$ remains the same, because $(1-x)+(1-y)-2(1-x)(1-y)=2-x-y-2+2 x+2 y-2 x y=x+y-2 x y$. Thus, $M(1-x, 1-y)=M(x, y)$. We have $x+y=2-(1-x)-(1-y)$, so at least one of $x+y$ and $(1-x)+(1-y)$ is greater than or equal to 1, which means we can assume without loss of generality that $x+y \\geq 1$.\n\nNow write $x+y=1+t$ with $t \\geq 0$. We also have $t \\leq 1$, because $x, y \\leq 1$ so $x+y \\leq 2$. From the inequality of the arithmetic and geometric means, we get\n\n$$\nx y \\leq\\left(\\frac{x+y}{2}\\right)^{2}=\\frac{(1+t)^{2}}{4}=\\frac{t^{2}+2 t+1}{4}\n$$\n\nWe have $b=x y-x-y+1=x y-(1+t)+1=x y-t=a-t$, so $b \\leq a$. Furthermore,\n\n$$\nc=x+y-2 x y \\geq(1+t)-2 \\cdot \\frac{t^{2}+2 t+1}{4}=\\frac{2+2 t}{2}-\\frac{t^{2}+2 t+1}{2}=\\frac{1-t^{2}}{2}.\n$$\n\nIf $t \\leq \\frac{1}{3}$, then $c \\geq \\frac{1-t^{2}}{2} \\geq \\frac{1-\\frac{1}{9}}{2}=\\frac{4}{9}$, and thus $M(x, y) \\geq \\frac{4}{9}$.\nThe remaining case is $t>\\frac{1}{3}$. We have $c=x+y-2 x y=1+t-2 a>\\frac{4}{3}-2 a$. We have $M(x, y) \\geq \\max \\left(a, \\frac{4}{3}-2 a\\right)$, so\n\n$$\n3 M(x, y) \\geq a+a+\\left(\\frac{4}{3}-2 a\\right)=\\frac{4}{3},\n$$\n\nwhich implies that $M(x, y) \\geq \\frac{4}{9}$.\nWe conclude that the minimum value of $M(x, y)$ is $\\frac{4}{9}$.<|im_end|>\n"}

When car A and car C meet, car B has completed exactly $\\frac{3}{8}$ of the total distance. Car C arrives at $A$ at 10:00 AM, and at 10:30 AM, when car B reaches $A$, car A is still 84 kilometers away from $B$. What is the distance between $A$ and $B$ in kilometers?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Algebra, Solution:\u3010Analysis\u3011First, based on the fact that when A and C meet, they have walked half the total distance, and B has walked $\\frac{3}{8}$ of the total distance, we can set up a relationship equation for the speeds of A, B, and C. Then, based on C walking half the distance in 3 hours and B walking the entire distance in 3.5 hours, we can set up another equation for the speed relationship between B and C. The key is to find the speed ratio of A to B. According to the distance from A to B being 84 kilometers, we can determine the corresponding ratio, and thus find the required distance.\n\n\u3010Solution\u3011According to the problem, when A and C meet, they have walked half the total distance, and B has walked $\\frac{3}{8}$ of the total distance, i.e., $\\frac{3}{4}(V$A $+V_{\\text{C}})=V_{\\text{B}}$. (1)\n\nAlso, C walks half the distance in 3 hours, and B walks the entire distance in 3.5 hours, i.e., $6 V_{\\text{C}}=3.5 V_{\\text{B}}$. (2)\nFrom (1) and (2), we get: $V_{\\text{A}}: V_{\\text{B}}=3: 4$. Therefore, the ratio of the distances traveled by A and B is 3:4.\nOne unit of distance is: $84 \\div(4-3)=84$ kilometers.\nThe total distance is: $84 \\times 4=336$ kilometers.\nTherefore, the answer is: 336 kilometers.<|im_end|>\n"}

Let $\\angle A = 37^\\circ$, $\\angle D = 53^\\circ$, and $M$ and $N$ be the [midpoints](https:\/\/artofproblemsolving.com\/wiki\/index.php\/Midpoint) of $\\overline{BC}$ and $\\overline{AD}$, respectively. Find the length $MN$.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Geometry, Solution:Solution 1\nExtend $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{CD}$ to meet at a point $E$. Then $\\angle AED = 180 - 53 - 37 = 90^{\\circ}$.\n\n\nAs $\\angle AED = 90^{\\circ}$, note that the midpoint of $\\overline{AD}$, $N$, is the center of the [circumcircle](https:\/\/artofproblemsolving.com\/wiki\/index.php\/Circumcircle) of $\\triangle AED$. We can do the same with the circumcircle about $\\triangle BEC$ and $M$ (or we could apply the homothety to find $ME$ in terms of $NE$). It follows that\n\\[NE = ND = \\frac {AD}{2} = 1004, \\quad ME = MC = \\frac {BC}{2} = 500.\\]\nThus $MN = NE - ME = \\boxed{504}$.\n\nFor purposes of rigor we will show that $E,M,N$ are collinear. Since $\\overline{BC} \\parallel \\overline{AD}$, then $BC$ and $AD$ are [homothetic](https:\/\/artofproblemsolving.com\/wiki\/index.php\/Homothecy) with respect to point $E$ by a ratio of $\\frac{BC}{AD} = \\frac{125}{251}$. Since the homothety carries the midpoint of $\\overline{BC}$, $M$, to the midpoint of $\\overline{AD}$, which is $N$, then $E,M,N$ are [collinear](https:\/\/artofproblemsolving.com\/wiki\/index.php\/Collinear).\n\nSolution 2\n\nLet $F,G,H$ be the feet of the [perpendiculars](https:\/\/artofproblemsolving.com\/wiki\/index.php\/Perpendicular) from $B,C,M$ onto $\\overline{AD}$, respectively. Let $x = NH$, so $DG = 1004 - 500 - x = 504 - x$ and $AF = 1004 - (500 - x) = 504 + x$. Also, let $h = BF = CG = HM$. \nBy AA~, we have that $\\triangle AFB \\sim \\triangle CGD$, and so \n\\[\\frac{BF}{AF} = \\frac {DG}{CG} \\Longleftrightarrow \\frac{h}{504+x} = \\frac{504-x}{h} \\Longrightarrow x^2 + h^2 = 504^2.\\]\nBy the [Pythagorean Theorem](https:\/\/artofproblemsolving.com\/wiki\/index.php\/Pythagorean_Theorem) on $\\triangle MHN$,\n\\[MN^{2} = x^2 + h^2 = 504^2,\\] so $MN = \\boxed{504}$.\n\nSolution 3\nIf you drop perpendiculars from $B$ and $C$ to $AD$, and call the points where they meet $\\overline{AD}$, $E$ and $F$ respectively, then $FD = x$ and $EA = 1008-x$ , and so you can solve an equation in tangents. Since $\\angle{A} = 37$ and $\\angle{D} = 53$, you can solve the equation [by cross-multiplication]:\n\\begin{align*}\\tan{37}\\times (1008-x) &= \\tan{53} \\times x\\\\ \\frac{(1008-x)}{x} &= \\frac{\\tan{53}}{\\tan{37}} = \\frac{\\sin{53}}{\\cos{53}} \\times\\frac{\\sin{37}}{\\cos{37}}\\end{align*}\nHowever, we know that $\\cos{90-x} = \\sin{x}$ and $\\sin{90-x} = \\cos{x}$ are co-functions. Applying this,\n\\begin{align*}\\frac{(1008-x)}{x} &= \\frac{\\sin^2{53}}{\\cos^2{53}} \\\\ x\\sin^2{53} &= 1008\\cos^2{53} - x\\cos^2{53}\\\\ x(\\sin^2{53}  + \\cos^2{53}) &= 1008\\cos^2{53}\\\\ x = 1008\\cos^2{53} &\\Longrightarrow 1008-x = 1008\\sin^2{53} \\end{align*}\nNow, if we can find $1004 - (EA + 500)$, and the height of the trapezoid, we can create a right triangle and use the [Pythagorean Theorem](https:\/\/artofproblemsolving.com\/wiki\/index.php\/Pythagorean_Theorem) to find $MN$. \nThe leg of the right triangle along the horizontal is:\n\\[1004 - 1008\\sin^2{53} - 500 = 504 - 1008\\sin^2{53}.\\]\nNow to find the other leg of the right triangle (also the height of the trapezoid), we can simplify the following expression:\n\\begin{align*}\\tan{37} \\times 1008 \\sin^2{53} = \\tan{37} \\times 1008 \\cos^2{37} = 1008\\cos{37}\\sin{37} = 504\\sin74\\end{align*}\nNow we used Pythagorean Theorem and get that $MN$ is equal to:\n\\begin{align*}&\\sqrt{(1008\\sin^2{53} + 500 -1004)^2 + (504\\sin{74})^2} = 504\\sqrt{1-2\\sin^2{53} + \\sin^2{74}} \\end{align*}\nHowever, $1-2\\sin^2{53} = \\cos^2{106}$ and $\\sin^2{74} = \\sin^2{106}$ so now we end up with:\n\\[504\\sqrt{\\cos^2{106} + \\sin^2{106}} =\\fbox{504}.\\]\n\nSolution 4\nPlot the trapezoid such that $B=\\left(1000\\cos 37^\\circ, 0\\right)$, $C=\\left(0, 1000\\sin 37^\\circ\\right)$, $A=\\left(2008\\cos 37^\\circ, 0\\right)$, and $D=\\left(0, 2008\\sin 37^\\circ\\right)$.\nThe midpoints of the requested sides are $\\left(500\\cos 37^\\circ, 500\\sin 37^\\circ\\right)$ and $\\left(1004\\cos 37^\\circ, 1004\\sin 37^\\circ\\right)$.\nTo find the distance from $M$ to $N$, we simply apply the distance formula and the Pythagorean identity $\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x = 1$ to get $MN=\\boxed{504}$.\n\n\nSolution 5\nSimilar to solution 1; Notice that it forms a right triangle. Remembering that the median to the hypotenuse is simply half the length of the hypotenuse, we quickly see that the length is $\\frac{2008}{2}-\\frac{1000}{2}=504$.\n\nSolution 6\nObviously, these angles are random--the only special thing about them is that they add up to 90. So we might as well let the given angles equal 45 and 45, and now the answer is trivially $\\boxed{504}$. (The trapezoid is isosceles, and you see two 45-45-90 triangles;from there you can get the answer.)<|im_end|>\n"}

Determine the smallest and largest percentage of the total number of shares in the lot that the Dvaneft share package can constitute.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Algebra, Solution:# Solution.\n\nLet's introduce the following notations:\n\n$x$ - the price of one share of Dvanefte,\n\n$y$ - the price of one share of Raznefte,\n\n$z$ - the price of one share of Trinefte,\n\n$n$ - the number of shares in a Dvanefte package,\n\n$m$ - the number of shares in a Raznefte package.\n\nThe other conditions of the problem can be written as a system of equations and inequalities:\n$\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}4 x n=y m, \\\\ x n+y m=z(m+n), \\\\ 16 \\leq y-x \\leq 20, \\\\ 42 \\leq z \\leq 60 ;\\end{array}\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{m}{n}=\\frac{4 x}{y}, \\\\ y=x+a, \\\\ z=x+\\frac{a m}{n+m}, \\\\ 16 \\leq a \\leq 20, \\\\ 42 \\leq z \\leq 60,\\end{array}\\right.\\right.$\n\nWe need to find the limits of the value $\\frac{n}{n+m+(n+m)} \\cdot 100 \\%=\\frac{n}{2(n+m)} 100 \\%$.\n\nIf we can find the ratio $\\frac{m}{n}$, the problem will be solved, since $\\frac{2(n+m)}{n}=2\\left(1+\\frac{m}{n}\\right)$.\n\nFirst, let's determine under what conditions the percentage of Raznefte shares in the total lot will be the smallest. For this, $\\frac{n}{2(n+m)} \\rightarrow \\min$, if $n \\rightarrow \\min , m \\rightarrow \\max , y-x \\rightarrow \\min$, therefore, $y-x=16, a=16$. If $n \\rightarrow \\min , m \\rightarrow \\max$, then $z=x+\\frac{16 m}{n+m} \\rightarrow \\max$, therefore, $z=60$.\n\nThen, $\\frac{m}{n}=\\frac{4 x}{x+16}, x=\\frac{16 m}{4 n-m}, z=\\frac{16 m}{4 n-m}+\\frac{16 m}{n+m}=60$.\n\n$16 m(m+n)+16 m(4 n-m)=60(4 n-m)(n+m), 80 m n=60\\left(4 n^{2}+3 m n-m^{2}\\right), 3 m^{2}-5 m n-12 n^{2}=0$, $3\\left(\\frac{m}{n}\\right)^{2}-5 \\frac{m}{n}-12=0, \\frac{m}{n}=3, \\frac{m}{n}=-\\frac{4}{3}$.\n\nAccording to the problem's conditions, we choose $m=3 n$, then the smallest percentage $\\frac{n}{2(n+m)} 100 \\%=12.5 \\%$.\n\nSimilarly, let's find the largest percentage:\n\nFor this, $\\frac{n}{2(n+m)} \\rightarrow \\max$, if $n \\rightarrow \\max , m \\rightarrow \\min , y-x \\rightarrow \\max$, therefore, $y-x=20, a=20$.\n\nIf $n \\rightarrow \\max , m \\rightarrow \\min$, then $z=x+\\frac{20 m}{n+m} \\rightarrow \\min$, therefore, $z=42$.\n\nThen, $x=\\frac{20 m}{4 n-m}, z=\\frac{20 m}{4 n-m}+\\frac{20 m}{n+m}=42$,\n\n$21 m^{2}-13 m n-84 n^{2}=0$\n\n$21\\left(\\frac{m}{n}\\right)^{2}-13 \\frac{m}{n}-84=0, \\frac{m}{n}=\\frac{7}{3}, \\frac{m}{n}=-\\frac{12}{7}$.\n\nAccording to the problem's conditions, we choose $m=\\frac{7 n}{3}$, the largest percentage $\\frac{n}{2(n+m)} 100 \\%=15 \\%$.\n\nAnswer. The lot contains from $12.5 \\%$ to $15 \\%$ of Dvanefte shares from their total number.<|im_end|>\n"}

We are given a four-digit number $\\overline{abcd}$ which is a perfect square and satisfies the equation $\\overline{ab} = 3 \\cdot \\overline{cd} + 1$.\n2. Let $\\overline{abcd} = x^2$ where $x$ is an integer in the range $[32, 99]$ (since $32^2 = 1024$ and $99^2 = 9801$ are the smallest and largest four-digit perfect squares, respectively).\n3. We can express $\\overline{abcd}$ as $100 \\cdot \\overline{ab} + \\overline{cd}$.\n4. Substituting $\\overline{ab} = 3 \\cdot \\overline{cd} + 1$ into the expression for $\\overline{abcd}$, we get:\n   \\[\n   100 \\cdot (3 \\cdot \\overline{cd} + 1) + \\overline{cd} = x^2\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we have:\n   \\[\n   300 \\cdot \\overline{cd} + 100 + \\overline{cd} = x^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   301 \\cdot \\overline{cd} + 100 = x^2\n   \\]\n5. Rearranging, we get:\n   \\[\n   x^2 = 301 \\cdot \\overline{cd} + 100\n   \\]\n6. We need to find $x$ such that $x^2 - 100$ is divisible by 301. This implies:\n   \\[\n   x^2 \\equiv 100 \\pmod{301}\n   \\]\n7. We solve the congruence $x^2 \\equiv 100 \\pmod{301}$. This can be rewritten as:\n   \\[\n   (x - 10)(x + 10) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{301}\n   \\]\n8. Since $301 = 7 \\times 43$, we need $x - 10$ or $x + 10$ to be divisible by 7 and the other by 43. We consider the following cases:\n   - $x - 10 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$ and $x + 10 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{43}$\n   - $x - 10 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{43}$ and $x + 10 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$\n9. Solving $x - 10 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$, we get $x \\equiv 10 \\pmod{7}$, which simplifies to $x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$. Thus, $x = 7k + 3$ for some integer $k$.\n10. Solving $x + 10 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{43}$, we get $x \\equiv -10 \\pmod{43}$, which simplifies to $x \\equiv 33 \\pmod{43}$. Thus, $x = 43m + 33$ for some integer $m$.\n11. We now solve the system of congruences:\n    \\[\n    x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    x \\equiv 33 \\pmod{43}\n    \\]\n12. Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we find a common solution. We write $x = 7k + 3$ and substitute into the second congruence:\n    \\[\n    7k + 3 \\equiv 33 \\pmod{43}\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    7k \\equiv 30 \\pmod{43}\n    \\]\n13. Solving for $k$, we find the multiplicative inverse of 7 modulo 43, which is 37 (since $7 \\cdot 37 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{43}$):\n    \\[\n    k \\equiv 30 \\cdot 37 \\pmod{43}\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    k \\equiv 1110 \\pmod{43}\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    k \\equiv 34 \\pmod{43}\n    \\]\n14. Thus, $k = 43n + 34$ for some integer $n$, and substituting back, we get:\n    \\[\n    x = 7(43n + 34) + 3\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    x = 301n + 241\n    \\]\n15. Since $x$ must be in the range $[32, 99]$, we check $n = 0$:\n    \\[\n    x = 241\n    \\]\n    This is not in the range $[32, 99]$. Therefore, we need to check the other case:\n16. Solving $x - 10 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{43}$, we get $x \\equiv 10 \\pmod{43}$, which simplifies to $x = 43m + 10$ for some integer $m$.\n17. Solving $x + 10 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$, we get $x \\equiv -10 \\pmod{7}$, which simplifies to $x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$. Thus, $x = 7k + 4$ for some integer $k$.\n18. We now solve the system of congruences:\n    \\[\n    x \\equiv 10 \\pmod{43}\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}\n    \\]\n19. Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we find a common solution. We write $x = 43m + 10$ and substitute into the second congruence:\n    \\[\n    43m + 10 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    43m \\equiv -6 \\pmod{7}\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    43 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    m \\equiv -6 \\pmod{7}\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    m \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}\n    \\]\n20. Thus, $m = 7n + 1$ for some integer $n$, and substituting back, we get:\n    \\[\n    x = 43(7n + 1) + 10\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    x = 301n + 53\n    \\]\n21. Since $x$ must be in the range $[32, 99]$, we check $n = 0$:\n    \\[\n    x = 53\n    \\]\n22. Therefore, $x = 53$ is the only solution in the range $[32, 99]$. We calculate:\n    \\[\n    \\overline{abcd} = 53^2 = 2809\n    \\]\n23. We verify the condition $\\overline{ab} = 3 \\cdot \\overline{cd} + 1$:\n    \\[\n    \\overline{ab} = 28, \\quad \\overline{cd} = 09\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    28 = 3 \\cdot 9 + 1\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    28 = 27 + 1\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    28 = 28\n    \\]\n    The condition is satisfied.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2809}$<|im_end|>\n"}

The $k^\\text{th}$ pirate to take a share takes $\\frac{k}{12}$ of the coins that remain in the chest. The number of coins initially in the chest is the smallest number for which this arrangement will allow each pirate to receive a positive whole number of coins. How many coins does the $12^{\\text{th}}$ pirate receive?\n$\\textbf{(A)} \\ 720 \\qquad  \\textbf{(B)} \\ 1296 \\qquad  \\textbf{(C)} \\ 1728 \\qquad  \\textbf{(D)} \\ 1925 \\qquad  \\textbf{(E)} \\ 3850$<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Number Theory, Solution:Solution 1\nThe first pirate takes $\\frac{1}{12}$ of the $x$ coins, leaving $\\frac{11}{12} x$.\nThe second pirate takes $\\frac{2}{12}$ of the remaining coins, leaving $\\frac{10}{12}\\cdot   \\frac{11}{12}*x$.\nNote that\n$12^{11} = (2^2 \\cdot 3)^{11} = 2^{22} \\cdot 3^{11}$\n$11! = 11 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2$\n\nAll the $2$s and $3$s cancel out of $11!$, leaving\n$11 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 5 = 1925$\nin the numerator.\n\nWe know there were just enough coins to cancel out the denominator in the fraction. So, at minimum, $x$ is the denominator, leaving $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }1925}$ coins for the twelfth pirate.\n\nSolution 2\nThe answer cannot be an even number. Here is why:\nConsider the highest power of 2 that divides the starting number of coins, and consider how this value changes as each pirate takes their share. At each step, the size of the pile is multiplied by some $\\frac{n}{12}$. This means the highest power of 2 that divides the number of coins is continually decreasing or staying the same (except once, briefly, when we multiply by $\\frac{2}{3}$ for pirate 4, but it immediately drops again in the next step).\nTherefore, if the 12th pirate's coin total were even, then it can't be the smallest possible value, because we can safely cut the initial pot (and all the intermediate totals) in half. We could continue halving the result until the 12th pirate's total is finally odd.\nOnly one of the choices given is odd, $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }1925}$.\nNote that if there had been multiple odd answer choices, we could repeat the reasoning above to see that the value also must not be divisible by 3.<|im_end|>\n"}

Successful Pairs. Vasya bought $n$ pairs of identical socks. For $n$ days, Vasya had no problems: every morning he took a new pair from the closet and wore it all day. After $n$ days, Vasya's mother washed all the socks in the washing machine and paired them up as they came out, since, to reiterate, the socks are identical. We will call a pair of socks successful if both socks in this pair were worn by Vasya on the same day.\n\na) (7 - $\\mathbf{1 1}$ classes, 2 points) Find the probability that all the resulting pairs are successful.\n\nb) (8 - $\\mathbf{1 1}$ classes, 3 points) Prove that the expected number of successful pairs is greater than 0.5.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Combinatorics, Solution:Solution. a) The probability that the first pair turned out to be a successful one is $\\frac{1}{2 n-1}$, since when the mother took the first sock in her hand, there were $2 n-1$ socks left, and only one of them forms a successful pair with the first.

This implies that the numbers that appear in the second row of the table are obtained from the numbers that appear in the first row by adding 7. For example, Jo\u00e3o will call his parents on Sundays for calls numbered\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}\n1 \\\\\n1+7=8 \\\\\n8+7=15 \\\\\n15+7=22 \\\\\n22+7=29 \\\\\n29+7=36\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nthat is, in the numbers that leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 7.

The gathered crowd was mostly amazed that a door had flown a considerable distance. To be calculated: with what force in kg did the exploding gas mixture press the door in the final phase of the explosion? Furthermore, how long did the explosion last, assuming that the pressure acting on the door increased uniformly from 0 to its final high value? The dimensions of the door are: $a=2.20 \\mathrm{~m}, b=1.15 \\mathrm{~m}$, its mass is $m=30 \\mathrm{~kg}$. The door flew $s=80 \\mathrm{~m}$ horizontally from its original position, the height of the floor was $h=6 \\mathrm{~m}$. The temperature of the exploding gas mixture can be assumed to be $t=1500^{\\circ}$, and the expansion coefficient of the gas mixture is $\\alpha=\\frac{1}{273}$.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Other, Solution:For approximate calculations, we can assume that before the explosion, the room was at normal atmospheric pressure (760 mm) and a temperature of $0^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. The air in the room heated up to $t=1500^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ as a result of the explosion, while the volume remained constant, so the final internal pressure was\n\n$$\np^{\\prime}=760\\left(1+\\frac{1500}{273}\\right)\n$$\n\nFrom this, we need to subtract the pressure acting on the outer surface of the door:\n\n$$\np=760\\left(1+\\frac{1500}{273}\\right)-760=760 \\frac{1500}{273} \\mathrm{~mm} \\text { (mercury). }\n$$\n\nThus, the final value of the force acting on the door is\n\n$$\nP=\\frac{76 \\cdot 1500 \\cdot 13.56 \\cdot 220 \\cdot 115}{273 \\cdot 10^{3}} \\mathrm{kgs}=143200 \\mathrm{kgs} .\n$$\n\nTo answer the second question, we first need to calculate the initial speed of the door. The door fell for $t$ (sec), so $\\frac{g}{2} t^{2}=6$, from which\n\n$$\nt=1.1(\\mathrm{sec})\n$$\n\nThus, the initial horizontal speed was\n\n$$\nv=\\frac{80}{1.1}=72.7 \\frac{\\mathrm{m}}{\\mathrm{sec}} \\text { . }\n$$\n\nAccording to Newton's third law, the change in momentum is equal to the impulse of the force. Here, the force continuously increased to reach its final large value. For this approximate calculation, we can assume that the increase was uniform, so in the impulse calculation, we can take the average value of the force: $\\frac{0+P}{2}$ as a constant acting force, thus\n\n$$\nm v=\\frac{1}{2} P \\cdot t^{\\prime}\n$$\n\nwhere $t^{\\prime}$ represents the duration of the explosion.

A circle is also considered the same structure after rotation. For convenience, draw a circle, fill in the numbers of the bottom actors inside the circle, and fill in the numbers of the top actors outside the circle. Figure 20 is a tower of 14 people.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Combinatorics, Solution:Let the sum of the elements in groups $A$ and $B$ be denoted as $x$ and $y$ respectively.\nThen $y = 2x$.\nTherefore, $3x = x + y = 1 + 2 + \\cdots + 12 = 78 \\Rightarrow x = 26$.\nClearly, $1, 2 \\in A, 11, 12 \\in B$.\nLet $A = \\{1, 2, a, b, c, d\\} (a < b < c < d)$.\nIf $d \\leq 7$, then\n$$\na + b + c + d \\leq 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 22.\n$$\n\nThus, $a + b + c + d = 23$, and $a \\geq 3, 8 \\leq d \\leq 10$.\n(1) $d = 8$.\n\nThen $A = \\{1, 2, a, b, c, 8\\}, c \\leq 7, a + b + c = 15$.\nThus, $(a, b, c) = (3, 5, 7)$ or $(4, 5, 6)$, i.e.,\n$A = \\{1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8\\}$ or $A = \\{1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8\\}$.\n(i) If $A = \\{1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8\\}$, then\n$B = \\{4, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12\\}$.\nSince set $B$ contains $4, 6, 11, 12$, set $A$ must have 1 adjacent to 3, 1 adjacent to 5, 5 adjacent to 7, and 8 adjacent to 3.\n\nIn this case, there is only one arrangement, resulting in the tower in Figure 21.\nUse 21\n(ii) If $A = \\{1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8\\}$, then\n$$\nB = \\{3, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12\\}.\n$$\n\nSimilarly, set $A$ must have 1 adjacent to 2, 5 adjacent to 6, and 4 adjacent to 8. In this case, there are two arrangements, resulting in the two towers in Figure 22.\n(2) $d = 9$.\nThen $A = \\{1, 2, a, b, c, 9\\}, c \\leq 8, a + b + c = 14$.\nThus, $(a, b, c) = (3, 5, 6)$ or $(3, 4, 7)$, i.e.,\n$A = \\{1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9\\}$ or $A = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9\\}$.\n(i) If $A = \\{1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9\\}$, then\n$B = \\{4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12\\}$.\nTo get $4, 10, 12$ in set $B$, set $A$ must have 1, 3, 9 all adjacent, which is impossible.\n(ii) If $A = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9\\}$, then\n$B = \\{5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12\\}$.\nTo get $6, 8, 12$ in set $B$, set $A$ must have 2 adjacent to 4, 1 adjacent to 7, and 9 adjacent to 3. Thus, there are two arrangements, resulting in the two towers in Figure 23.\n(3) $d = 10$.\nThen $A = \\{1, 2, a, b, c, 10\\}, c \\leq 9, a + b + c = 13$.\nThus, $(a, b, c) = (3, 4, 6)$, i.e.,\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}\nA = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 10\\}, \\\\\nB = \\{5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12\\}.\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nTo get $8, 9, 11, 12$ in set $B$, set $A$ must have 6 adjacent to 2, 6 adjacent to 3, 10 adjacent to 1, and 10 adjacent to 2. Thus, there is only one arrangement, resulting in the tower in Figure 24.\nTherefore, there are 6 structurally different towers, i.e.,\n$T(6) = 6$.\nAs the value of $n$ increases, the number of such arrangements $T(n)$ increases rapidly, making the situation more complex.<|im_end|>\n"}

He displayed 120 rings, which were placed on tables along the walls of the hall, forming one large circle. The tour started at the entrance door in a marked direction. From there, every third ring in the row was gold, every fourth ring was antique, and every tenth ring had a diamond. A ring that did not have any of these three properties was a counterfeit.\n\nHow many gold rings were on display that were also antique and had a diamond? How many counterfeits did Mr. Silver display?\n\n(L. Hozov\u00e1)\n\nHint. According to what rules were the rings with different combinations of the three mentioned properties placed?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Number Theory, Solution:Every 3rd ring was golden, every 4th was antique, and every 10th had a diamond. Thus,\n\n- the number of golden rings was $120: 3=40$,\n- the number of antique rings was $120: 4=30$,\n- the number of rings with a diamond was $120: 10=12$.\n\nWhen counting rings with multiple properties, we first determine the regularity with which they appeared at the exhibition: every 12th ring was both golden and antique, every 30th ring was golden with a diamond, and every 20th ring was antique with a diamond (here, 20 is the least common multiple of the numbers 4 and 10). Thus,\n\n- the number of golden antique rings was $120: 12=10$,\n- the number of golden rings with a diamond was $120: 30=4$,\n- the number of antique rings with a diamond was $120: 20=6$.\n\nFurthermore, every 60th ring had all three properties (60 is the least common multiple of the numbers 3, 4, and 10), thus\n\n- the number of golden antique rings with a diamond was $120: 60=2$.\n\nWhen counting rings with any of the mentioned properties, we must be cautious: 10 rings were both golden and antique, 2 of which also had a diamond, so the number of golden antique rings without a diamond was $10-2=8$. Similarly, the number of golden non-antique rings with a diamond was $4-2=2$ and the number of non-golden antique rings with a diamond was $6-2=4$.\n\nThe number of golden rings with some additional property was $2+8+2=12$, while the total number of golden rings was 40, so the number of golden non-antique rings without a diamond was $40-12=28$. Similarly, the number of non-golden antique rings without a diamond was $30-(2+8+4)=16$ and the number of non-golden non-antique rings with a diamond was $12-(2+2+4)=4$.\n\nThe previous counts and relationships can be illustrated using a Venn diagram as follows:\n\n![](https:\/\/cdn.mathpix.com\/cropped\/2024_04_17_fc767241fb97c8703187g-4.jpg?height=448&width=780&top_left_y=2112&top_left_x=638)\n\nThe number of rings with any of the three properties (i.e., rings that were not fakes) was $2+8+4+2+28+16+4=64$. Therefore, the number of fakes was $120-64=56$.\n\nNote. If we denote the three basic sets of rings as $Z, S$, and $D$, the initial part of the solution can be summarized as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n|Z|=40, \\quad|S|=30, \\quad|D|=12 \\\\\n|Z \\cap S|=10, \\quad|Z \\cap D|=4, \\quad|S \\cap D|=6, \\\\\n|Z \\cap S \\cap D|=2 .\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nIn the next part, we determined the number of elements in the union $Z \\cup S \\cup D$ by gradually expressing the number of elements in mutually disjoint* subsets $(Z \\cap S) \\backslash(Z \\cap S \\cap D)$, $(Z \\cap D) \\backslash(Z \\cap S \\cap D)$, etc., which we then summed. More concisely, the same result can be obtained by the following calculation:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n|Z \\cup S \\cup D| & =|Z|+|S|+|D|-|Z \\cap S|-|Z \\cap D|-|S \\cap D|+|Z \\cap S \\cap D|= \\\\\n& =40+30+12-10-4-6+2=64 .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis relationship is known as the principle of inclusion and exclusion. To justify it generally (or to further generalize it), it suffices to verify that each of the disjoint parts of the Venn diagram is counted exactly once.<|im_end|>\n"}

Let the first mentioned side be $B C=\\sqrt{3} A M$, where $M$ is the orthocenter of the triangle, and the second side be $A B=1+\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3}$.\n\n![](https:\/\/cdn.mathpix.com\/cropped\/2024_05_02_7c3e4b51ddf2c51d5df1g-1.jpg?height=444&width=764&top_left_y=304&top_left_x=667)\n\nLet the point opposite to $B$ on the circumcircle of the triangle be $B^{\\prime}$. Then $B^{\\prime} A$ is perpendicular to $A B$, and thus parallel to $C M$, similarly $B^{\\prime} C \\| A M$, so $A, C, B^{\\prime}$, and $M$ are the vertices of a parallelogram, and $A M=B^{\\prime} C$. This is also valid if $B^{\\prime}$ coincides with $A$ or $C$, because in this case there is a right angle at $C$ or $A$ in the triangle, so $M$ falls into the vertex of the right angle. In our problem, $B^{\\prime}=C$ is not possible, because if $A M=0$, then $B C=0$.\n\nAccordingly, in the right triangle $B B^{\\prime} C$, the leg $B C$ is $\\sqrt{3}$ times the leg $B^{\\prime} C$, so the triangle is similar to the parts of an isosceles triangle cut by its height, hence the angle at $B^{\\prime}$ is $60^{\\circ}$. If $A$ is on the arc of $B C$ containing $B^{\\prime}$, then $\\alpha=B A C \\varangle=60^{\\circ}$, and if it is on the other arc, then $\\alpha=120^{\\circ}-\\mathrm{az} 1$. as shown in the first figure at $A^{*}$ and $M^{*}$.\n\nKnowing $\\alpha$, we can construct the triangle, and in the calculation, we can follow the construction. We construct a circle with radius $\\varrho=1$ that is tangent to the sides of the angle $\\alpha$ at vertex $A$, and measure $A B$ on one side of the angle. The line $B C$ is given by the second tangent from $B$ to the circle, and a solution exists if this intersects the other side of $\\alpha$. In the case of $\\alpha=60^{\\circ}$, we can easily find the angles: for the point of tangency $T$, $A T=\\sqrt{3}$, which can be the first part of $A B$. Taking the second part $T U=1$, the remaining part $U B=\\sqrt{2}$ is equal to $U O$, so the triangle $O U B$ is isosceles, hence the angle $O B U$ is half of the exterior angle $O U T$. The angle $C B A$ is twice the angle $O B U$ because $B C$ is the reflection of $B A$ over the axis $B O$, so $\\beta=C B A \\varangle=O U T \\varangle=45^{\\circ}$. Therefore, the angles of the triangle $A B C$ are $60^{\\circ}, 45^{\\circ}, 75^{\\circ}$.\n\n![](https:\/\/cdn.mathpix.com\/cropped\/2024_05_02_7c3e4b51ddf2c51d5df1g-1.jpg?height=461&width=702&top_left_y=1472&top_left_x=706)\n\nIn the case of $\\alpha=120^{\\circ}$, $A T=1 \/ \\sqrt{3}$, and thus from the triangle $B O T$,\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{ctg} \\frac{\\beta}{2}=T B \/ O T=1+\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3}-1 \/ \\sqrt{3} \\approx 3.569\n$$\n\nand in the second solution, the angles are $120^{\\circ}, 31.3^{\\circ}, 28.7^{\\circ}$\n\nKiss Katalin (Mak\u00f3, J\u00f3zsef A. g.

The functions $f(x)=2^{x}$ and $g(x)=-x^{2}+2 x+8$ are defined on the set of all real numbers, where $f(x)=2^{x}$ is an increasing function and has no zeros, while $g(x)=-x^{2}+2 x+8$ (a parabola) is an increasing function on the interval $(-\\infty ; 1)$, and a decreasing function on the interval $(1 ;+\\infty)$ (the point $x=1$ is the x-coordinate of the vertex) and has zeros at $x=-2$ and $x=4$.\n\nSince $f(-2)=2^{-2}=\\frac{1}{4}, g(-2)=0, f(-2)>g(-2) ; f(1)=$ $=2^{1}=2, g(1)=9, f(1)<g(1) ; f(4)=2^{4}=16, g(4)=0, f(4)>g(4)$, the graphs of the functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ do not intersect on the interval $(1 ; 4)$ (as they are monotonic and continuous), i.e., the given equation has another root on this interval.

The numbers $x$ and $x+32$ are three-digit and four-digit palindromes, respectively. What is the sum of the digits of $x$?\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 20 \\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 21 \\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 22 \\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 23 \\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 24$<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Number Theory, Solution:Solution 1\n$x$ is at most $999$, so $x+32$ is at most $1031$. The minimum value of $x+32$ is $1000$. However, the only palindrome between $1000$ and $1032$ is $1001$, which means that $x+32$ must be $1001$.\nIt follows that $x$ is $969$, so the sum of the digits is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}\\ 24}$.\n\nSolution 2\nFor $x+32$ to be a four-digit number, $x$ is in between $968$ and $999$. The palindromes in this range are $969$, $979$, $989$, and $999$, so the sum of the digits of $x$ can be $24$, $25$, $26$, or $27$. Only $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}\\ 24}$ is an option, and upon checking, $x+32=1001$ is indeed a palindrome.\n\nSolution 3\nSince we know $x+32$ to be $1 a a 1$ and the only palindrome that works is $0 = a$, that means $x+32 = 1001$, and so $x = 1001 - 32 = 969$. So, $9$ + $6$ + $9$ = $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}\\ 24}$.\n~songmath20<|im_end|>\n"}

Each time, Xiaoming has 1 candy left in his pocket, and Xiaoliang has 2 candies left in his pocket. To make the number of candies in Xiaoliang's pocket exactly 3 times that of Xiaoming's after 10 distributions, we can deduce through trial and error that if Xiaoliang wins 4 times, he will have 4 candies left in his pocket, and if Xiaoming wins 6 times, he will have 12 candies left in his pocket.

Therefore, the diagonal $AC$ rotates to the diagonal $CE$. Since point $M$ divides the diagonal $AC$ in the same ratio as point $N$ divides the diagonal $CE$, during the rotation, $M$ moves to $N$. Consequently, the line $BM$ rotated by $120^{\\circ}$ becomes the line $DN$, and the angle between these two lines, $\\angle BND$, is exactly $120^{\\circ}$. This means that $N$ lies on the $120^{\\circ}$-arc of the segment $BD$.\n\nThe circle centered at $C$ with radius $CB = CD$ passes through point $O$. Since $\\angle BOD = 120^{\\circ}$, the arc of this circle that lies within the hexagon is the $120^{\\circ}$-arc of the segment $BD$. Point $N$ lies on this arc, and thus $CN = CD = CO$. The triangle $ACE$ is equilateral, and its side is $\\sqrt{3}$ times the radius of the circumscribed circle: $CE = \\sqrt{3} CO$. From this, we can express the desired ratio:\n\n$$\nr = \\frac{CN}{CE} = \\frac{CO}{\\sqrt{3} CO} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\n$$\n\nRemark. Some people conjectured that $AM = CN = BC$, and they verified that if we place points $M$ and $N$ in this way, then $B$, $M$, and $N$ lie on the same line.

It follows that $(x y z)^{2}=x^{2} y^{2} z^{2}=6 \\times 12 \\times 2=144$. Hence $x y z$ equals either 12 or -12 .\nBecause $12-3 \\sqrt{7}0$. Hence $x y z>0$. We conclude that $x y z=12$.<|im_end|>\n"}

We will prove that there could not have been three or more birds of the same species. Indeed, suppose birds of the same species $A, B$, and $C$ sit in that exact order. Let there be $2x$ birds between $A$ and $B$, and $2y$ birds between $B$ and $C$, then there are $2x + 2y + 1$ birds between $A$ and $C$, which is an odd number of birds, contradicting the condition. Since there are no more than 2 birds of each species, there must be at least 1011 species.\n\nExample. We will provide an example where 1011 species could have been present. For instance, the birds could sit in pairs: two of the first species, two of the second species, and so on up to the 1010th species, with one more bird of the 1011th species at the end.

The cost of these is a whole number of pounds and $99 k$ pence, that is, a whole number of pounds less $k$ pence. Susanna spent \u00a365.76, that is, a whole number of pounds less 24 pence. It follows that $k$ pence is a whole number of pounds plus 24 pence. So $k$ is 24 or 124 or 224 or .... .

Find all such numbers.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Number Theory, Solution:150. a) Let $a$ be the first and $b$ the last digit of the number $N$ we are looking for. Then this number is equal to $1000 a + 100 a + 10 b + b = 1100 a + 11 b = 11(100 a + b)$. Since the number $N$ is a perfect square, it follows from its divisibility by 11 that it is also divisible by 121, i.e., $\\frac{N}{11} = 100 a + b$ is divisible by 11. But\n\n$$\n100 a + b = 99 a + (a + b) = 11 \\cdot 9 a + (a + b)\n$$\n\nTherefore, $a + b$ is divisible by 11. Since both $a$ and $b$ are no greater than 9 and $a$ is not equal to 0, we have $1 \\leqslant a + b \\leqslant 18$, and thus $a + b = 11$.\n\nFrom this,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n100 a + b & = 11 \\cdot 9 a + 11 = 11(9 a + 1) \\\\\n\\frac{N}{121} & = \\frac{100 a + b}{11} = 9 a + 1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSince $N$ is a perfect square, $\\frac{N}{121}$ is also a perfect square. But among the numbers of the form $9 a + 1$, where $a$ ranges from 1 to 9, only $9 \\cdot 7 + 1 = 64$ is a perfect square. Therefore, $N = 121 \\cdot 64 = 7744 = 88^2$.\n\nb) Let $a$ be the tens digit of this number, and $b$ the units digit. Then the number is $10 a + b$, and the number written with the same digits in reverse order is $10 b + a$. According to the problem's condition, $10 a + b + 10 b + a = 11(a + b) = k^2$.\n\nFrom this, it follows that $k^2$ is divisible by 11, so $a + b$ is also divisible by 11. Since $a + b \\leqslant 18$, this is only possible if $a + b = 11, k^2 = 121$. Thus, the numbers we are looking for are\n\n$$\n29, 38, 47, 56, 65, 74, 83, 92 \\text{. }\n$$<|im_end|>\n"}

Fix a red bead in the necklace. The 7 consecutive segments of 11 beads adjacent to it do not cover the entire necklace, as these segments contain no more than 49 blue beads out of 50.

Find the greatest possible value of the sum of the elements of $S$.\n\n[i]Proposed by Michael Tang[\/i]<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Number Theory, Solution:1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   We need to find a set \\( S \\) of 8 positive integers that is sum-complete and contains the elements \\(\\{1, 3\\}\\). The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in \\( S \\).\n\n2. **Initial Elements and Sum-Completeness:**\n   Since \\(\\{1, 3\\} \\subset S\\), the sums of subsets of \\( S \\) must include \\(1\\), \\(3\\), and \\(1+3=4\\). To ensure sum-completeness, we need to include \\(2\\) in \\( S \\) because \\(2\\) is the only missing integer between \\(1\\) and \\(4\\).\n\n3. **Current Set and Sums:**\n   Now, \\( S = \\{1, 2, 3\\} \\). The sums of subsets of \\( S \\) are:\n   \\[\n   \\{1, 2, 3, 1+2=3, 1+3=4, 2+3=5, 1+2+3=6\\}\n   \\]\n   So, the sums range from \\(1\\) to \\(6\\).\n\n4. **Adding the Next Element:**\n   To extend the range of sums, the next element should be \\(7\\) (the smallest integer greater than \\(6\\)). Now, \\( S = \\{1, 2, 3, 7\\} \\). The sums of subsets of \\( S \\) are:\n   \\[\n   \\{1, 2, 3, 7, 1+2=3, 1+3=4, 1+7=8, 2+3=5, 2+7=9, 3+7=10, 1+2+3=6, 1+2+7=10, 1+3+7=11, 2+3+7=12, 1+2+3+7=13\\}\n   \\]\n   So, the sums range from \\(1\\) to \\(13\\).\n\n5. **Adding Subsequent Elements:**\n   To continue extending the range, the next element should be \\(14\\) (the smallest integer greater than \\(13\\)). Now, \\( S = \\{1, 2, 3, 7, 14\\} \\). The sums of subsets of \\( S \\) are:\n   \\[\n   \\{1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 1+2=3, 1+3=4, 1+7=8, 1+14=15, 2+3=5, 2+7=9, 2+14=16, 3+7=10, 3+14=17, 7+14=21, \\ldots, 1+2+3+7+14=27\\}\n   \\]\n   So, the sums range from \\(1\\) to \\(27\\).\n\n6. **Continuing the Pattern:**\n   Following the same logic, the next elements should be \\(28\\), \\(56\\), and \\(112\\). This gives us the set \\( S = \\{1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 28, 56, 112\\} \\).\n\n7. **Sum of the Elements:**\n   The sum of the elements in \\( S \\) is:\n   \\[\n   1 + 2 + 3 + 7 + 14 + 28 + 56 + 112 = 223\n   \\]\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{223}\\)<|im_end|>\n"}

Let $A$ use $u$ bullets to hit 1 bird, and $B$ use $v$ bullets to hit 1 bird. Then $\\frac{x}{u}$ and $\\frac{y}{v}$ represent the number of birds obtained.

From $x-2 y=0$, we get $x=2 y$, substituting into $x^{2}+y^{2}=2880$ yields $y=24$.\n\nTherefore, $x=48, u=\\frac{576}{2 \\times 48-24}=8$.

Therefore, the difference in the ages of the two children is an odd number.\n\nIf this difference were 3 years or more, then the difference in the parents' ages would be 27 years or more.

An annulus is a shape made from two concentric circles. The diagram shows an annulus consisting of two concentric circles of radii 2 and 9 . Inside this annulus two circles are drawn without overlapping, each being tangent to both of the concentric circles that make the annulus. In a different annulus made by concentric circles of radii 1 and 9 , what would be the largest possible number of non-overlapping circles that could be drawn in this way?\nA 2\nB 3\nC 4\nD 5\nE 6<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Geometry, Solution:21. B The diameter of the non-overlapping circles is the difference between the radius of the large circle and the radius of the small circle, namely $9-1=8$. Thus the radius of each circle is $4 \\mathrm{~cm}$, and the centre of each circle is $1+4=5 \\mathrm{~cm}$ from the centre of the inner circle. The closest the circles could be is when they are touching. The diagram shows two of these circles and the inner circle of radius $1 \\mathrm{~cm}$. We need to establish the size of angle $C A B$. Since $5^{2}+5^{2}90^{\\circ}$, and hence it is not possible to fit 4 circles in the annulus.\nWe can also show that $\\angle C A B<120^{\\circ}$. For if $\\angle C A B=120^{\\circ}$, then $\\angle C A D=60^{\\circ}$ and $A D=2 \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nBut $A D=\\sqrt{5^{2}-4^{2}}=3$, so $\\angle C A D<60^{\\circ}$ and $\\angle C A B<120^{\\circ}$.

So suppose n > m is a solution. This suggests trying m+n, n: (m+n) 2 - (m+n)n - n 2 = m 2 + mn - n 2 = -(n 2 - mn - m 2 ) = 1 or -1. So if n > m is a solution, then m+n, n is another solution. Running this forward from 2,1 gives 3,2; 5,3; 8,5; 13,8; 21,13; 34,21; 55,34; 89,55; 144,89; 233,144; 377,233; 610,377; 987,610; 1597,987; 2584,1597. But how do we know that there are no other solutions? The trick is to run the recurrence the other way. For suppose n > m is a solution, then try m, n-m: m 2 - m(n-m) - (n-m) 2 = m 2 + mn - n 2 = -(n 2 - mn - m 2 ) = 1 or -1, so that also satisfies the equation. Also if m > 1, then m > n-m (for if not, then n >= 2m, so n(n - m) >= 2m 2 , so n 2 - nm - m 2 >= m 2 > 1). So given a solution n > m with m > 1, we have a smaller solution m > n-m. This process must eventually terminate, so it must finish at a solution n, 1 with n > 1. But the only such solution is 2, 1. Hence the starting solution must have been in the forward sequence from 2, 1.

The functions $f: x \\rightarrow 0$ and $f: x \\rightarrow x$ are solutions. We can also see that the function $f: x \\rightarrow -x$ is a solution. These functions are likely the only solutions; let's try to prove it.\n\nAmong these solutions, two are injective, and the equation involves an output variable, so we are inclined to show injectivity. However, this is impossible because the zero function is a solution to the problem without being injective. To have a chance of showing the injectivity of the function, we will set aside the zero function by only working with functions that admit a real number $l$ such that $f(l) \\neq 0$. If $f(a)=f(b)$, then by setting $y=a$ and $y=b$, we get $f(f(x) f(a))=f(x) a$ and $f(f(x) f(b))=f(x) b \\Longrightarrow f(x) a=f(x) b$. Thus, for $x=l$, we can divide by $f(l) \\neq 0$ and we get $a=b$ so $f$ is injective. Returning to the original equation, and setting $y=1$, we have $f(f(x) f(1))=f(x) \\Longrightarrow f(x) f(1)=x$. If $f(1)=0$, then by setting $x=1$ we find $0=1$ which is false, so $f(1) \\neq 0$. Thus $f(x)=\\frac{x}{f(1)}$ so we can write $f(x)=c x$ for all $x$.\n\nWith the original equation, this gives $f(f(x) f(y))=c^{3} x y=f(x) y=c x y$ so $c=0$ or $c= \\pm 1$. We recover the 3 solutions identified at the beginning.\n\n## Solution 2 :\n\nIn this equation, the left-hand term is symmetric in $x$ and $y$ while the right-hand term is not. In such a situation, it is interesting to use this symmetry, here it gives: $f(f(x) f(y))=f(x) y=x f(y)$. Therefore, for all non-zero real numbers $x, y$, $\\frac{f(x)}{x}=\\frac{f(y)}{y}$, so the term $\\frac{f(x)}{x}$ is constant and we can write $f(x)=c x$ for all non-zero $x$. Moreover, $f(0) \\cdot 1=0 \\cdot f(1) \\Longrightarrow f(0)=0$, so $f(x)=c x$ for all real $x \\cdot f(f(x) f(y))=c^{3} x y=f(x) y=c x y$ so $c=0$ or $c= \\pm 1$. We verify that the functions $f: x \\mapsto 0, f: x \\mapsto x$ and $f: x \\mapsto -x$ are indeed solutions to the equation.\n\n## Remark 9.\n\nThe trick of using the symmetry of one of the terms in the equation inevitably leads to a symmetric equality in $x$ and $y$. The trick in such cases is to group the $x$ variables on one side and the $y$ variables on the other to exploit this symmetry and find a constant expression. In the previous exercise, this gave $\\frac{f(x)}{x}$ constant. We leave it to the reader to establish the form of the functions $f$ satisfying $f(x)^{2^{x}}-f(y)^{2}+x^{4}-y^{4}=2\\left(x^{2} f(x)-y^{2} f(y)\\right)$.<|im_end|>\n"}

Either $y=1$, which provides a first solution $(x=y=1)$, or the right-hand side is even and the left-hand side contains an even number of terms (all odd), so $x$ is even. From there, we can factorize again by $(7+1)=2^{3}$, which brings us to: $7^{x-2}+7^{x-4}+\\cdots+7^{2}+1=2^{y-4}$. Once again, either $y=4$ which provides a second solution $(x=2)$, or both sides are even, so the first contains an even number of terms, $x$ is a multiple of 4. We can factorize the first member again as: $\\left(7^{2}+1\\right)\\left(7^{x-4}+7^{x-8}+\\ldots+7^{4}+1\\right)$.

This number is coprime with the two odd numbers, and the conclusion holds.\nReturning to the original problem.\nFor any positive integer $m$, partition the set\n$$\n\\{m, m+1, \\cdots, m+99\\}\n$$\n\ninto the following 17 sets:\n$$\nA_{i}=\\{m+6(i-1)+j \\mid j=0,1, \\cdots, 5\\}\n$$\n$(i=1,2, \\cdots, 16)$,\n$$\nA_{17}=\\{m+96, m+97, m+98, m+99\\} .\n$$\n\nLet $M$ be a 68-element subset of the set $\\{m, m+1, \\cdots, m+99\\}$.\n(1) If set $M$ has four elements from set $A_{17}$, since when $m$ is odd, $m+96, m+97, m+98$ are pairwise coprime; and when $m$ is even, $m+97, m+98, m+99$ are pairwise coprime, therefore, set $M$ contains at least three elements that are pairwise coprime.\n(2) If set $M$ has at most three elements from set $A_{17}$, then set $M$ has at least 65 elements from sets $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\cdots, A_{16}$.\n\nBy the pigeonhole principle, set $M$ must have at least five elements from one of the sets, say $A_{1}$. By the lemma, there exist three pairwise coprime elements among them. Therefore, set $M$ always contains three pairwise coprime elements.\n\nThus, $n=68$ meets the requirement, i.e., for any positive integer $m$, any 68-element subset of the set $\\{m, m+1, \\cdots, m+99\\}$ contains three elements that are pairwise coprime.\nIn summary, the minimum value of $n$ is 68.<|im_end|>\n"}

Moreover, to satisfy the fifth and first conditions, it makes sense to consider only those double-digit numbers that have at least two different multiples less than 100. All the valid options are listed in the left column of the following table. The right column then contains all their two-digit multiples that could potentially form the first and second double-digit numbers of the desired code.\n\n| 14 | $28,42,56,70,84,98$ |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| 16 | $32,48,64,80,96$ |\n| 18 | $36,54,72,90$ |\n| 27 | 54,81 |\n| 29 | 58,87 |\n\nIf we eliminate all double-digit numbers that do not satisfy the third or fourth conditions from the problem, only the following remain:\n\n| 14 | 70 |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| 16 | 96 |\n| 18 | $36,72,90$ |\n| 27 | 81 |\n| 29 | 58 |\n\nFrom this, it is clear that the last double-digit number must be 18. To satisfy the second condition, one of the remaining double-digit numbers must be 90, and to satisfy the fourth condition, 90 must be the first. For the same reason, 72 cannot be the second double-digit number, leaving only 36. Therefore, the final code can only be 903618, and by checking all the conditions from the problem, we confirm that this is indeed the case.\n\nNote. Besides the initial insight that 0 cannot be the last digit, we can also use the fact that 0 cannot be in the first or third position. (Otherwise, the first or second double-digit number would represent a single-digit number, so according to the fifth condition, the last double-digit number would also have to be a single-digit number, and 0 would have to be on the fifth position, which is impossible.) Therefore, 0 must be either in the second or fourth position. From the third condition, it follows that even digits can only be in even positions and odd digits in odd positions.

A car left the city for the village at the same time a cyclist left the village for the city. When the car and the cyclist met, the car immediately turned around and headed back to the city. As a result, the cyclist arrived in the city 35 minutes after the car. How many minutes did the cyclist spend on the entire journey, given that his speed is 4.5 times slower than the speed of the car?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Algebra, Solution:Answer: 55.\n\n![](https:\/\/cdn.mathpix.com\/cropped\/2024_05_06_b135fe79f2e6ed0cbffag-3.jpg?height=113&width=493&top_left_y=1217&top_left_x=478)\n\nFig. 7: to the solution of problem 8.5\n\nSolution. In Fig. 7, let's mark village $A$, city $B$, point $P$ where the car and the cyclist meet, and point $Q$, where the cyclist was when the car returned to the city. Since the speeds of the car and the cyclist differ by 4.5 times, then $A P: P B=1: 4.5=2: 9$. Since the car spent the same amount of time on the movements $B \\rightarrow P$ and $P \\rightarrow B$, the cyclist also spent the same amount of time on the corresponding movements $A \\rightarrow P$ and $P \\rightarrow Q$. Therefore, $A P: P Q: Q B=2: 2: 7$.\n\nSince the cyclist spent exactly 35 minutes on the movement $Q \\rightarrow B$, the total time spent on the movement $A \\rightarrow B$ is proportional: $35 \\cdot \\frac{11}{7}=55$ minutes.\n\nPasha listed all natural divisors of a natural number $k$ in ascending order and numbered them: the first, the second,\n\nPasha noticed that if the sixth divisor is multiplied by the thirteenth divisor, the result is the original number $k$.\n\nHow many natural divisors does the number $k$ have?\n\nAnswer: 18.\n\nSolution. Let the natural divisors of the number $k$ be ordered as follows:\n\n$$\n1=d_{1}<d_{2}<\\ldots<d_{6}<\\ldots<d_{13}<\\ldots<d_{m-1}<d_{m}=k\n$$\n\nThe numbers\n\n$$\n1=\\frac{k}{d_{m}}<\\frac{k}{d_{m-1}}<\\ldots<\\frac{k}{d_{6}}<\\ldots<\\frac{k}{d_{13}}<\\ldots<\\frac{k}{d_{2}}<\\frac{k}{d_{1}}=k\n$$\n\nare also divisors of the number $k$, they are distinct, and there are as many of them. Thus, these are the same numbers, only in reverse order. We get that\n\n$$\nd_{1}=\\frac{k}{d_{m}}, d_{2}=\\frac{k}{d_{m-1}}, \\ldots, \\quad d_{m}=\\frac{k}{d_{1}}\n$$\n\nThus, the divisors are divided into pairs of \"opposite\" divisors, which give the original number $k$ when multiplied:\n\n$$\nk=d_{1} \\cdot d_{m}=d_{2} \\cdot d_{m-1}=\\ldots\n$$\n\nIn each such pair, the sum of the indices of the divisors is $m+1$. Since by the condition $d_{6} \\cdot d_{13}=k$, we get that $m=6+13-1=18$.<|im_end|>\n"}

Carefully consider the cases of the placement of the black car. If it parks in spot number 1 or 50, the pink car can park in any of the 48 spots (numbered from 3 to 50 or from 1 to 48, respectively). If the black car parks in a spot numbered from 2 to 49, the pink car has only 47 options (all except the spot of the black car and the two adjacent spots). In total, there are $2 \\cdot 48 + 48 \\cdot 47 = 2352$ options.\n\nSolution II. Count the number of options as a difference: from the total number of possible ways to arrange the two cars, subtract the \"extra\" - the number of ways in which they are adjacent.\n\nIn total, we have 50 $\\cdot$ 49 options: for each of the 50 ways to choose a spot for the black car, there are 49 ways to choose a spot for the pink car. The number of options where the cars are adjacent is $49 \\cdot 2$: for each of the 49 ways to choose two adjacent parking spots, there are 2 ways to park the cars.\n\nThus, the answer is $50 \\cdot 49 - 49 \\cdot 2 = 2352$.<|im_end|>\n"}

Let's determine the number of these numbers. From 800 to 899, there are one hundred such numbers. Other numbers containing the digit 8 will be $152=19 \\times 8$.

This set is a strip between lines (in space - planes) passing through points $A_{i}$ and $A_{j}$ and perpendicular to the segment $A_{i} A_{j}$ (Fig.3); we will denote this strip by $\\Pi_{i j}$ below.\n\nFrom this observation, it follows that if we consider the convex hull $V$ of the given $n$ points - the smallest convex polygon (polyhedron) containing all these points - then all points $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ must lie on the boundary of the set $V$; none of them can be inside $V$: after all, $V$ is contained in each of the strips $\\Pi_{i j}$.\n\nThe solution to part (a) is now in two words. In this case, $V$ is a convex $n$-gon with vertices $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$. The sum of its angles is $180^{\\circ}(n-2)$, and if each of the angles is no more than $90^{\\circ}$, then\n\n$$\n180^{\\circ}(n-2) \\leq 90^{\\circ} n\n$$\n\nfrom which $n \\leq 4$.\n\nThe solution to the planar problem was submitted by many readers. The spatial problem is much more difficult, and we did not receive a complete proof from any of the readers. We will present a solution that was first found by the well-known geometers L. Danzer and B. Gr\u00fcnbaum (1962).\n\nConsider, in addition to the polyhedron $V$ (here $V$ can be understood as either the convex hull of the given $n$ points $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ or the intersection - the common part - of all $n(n-1) \/ 2$ strips $\\Pi_{i j}$) the following polyhedra: $V_{i}$,\n\nobtained from $V$ by translation by the vector $\\overrightarrow{A_{1} A_{i}}\\left(i=1,2, \\ldots, n ; V_{1}\\right.$, of course, coincides with $V$), and $V V^{\\prime}$, obtained from $V$ by stretching (homothety) with a coefficient of 2 and center at point $A_{1}$.\n\nWe will prove the following three statements.\n\n$1^{o}$. The polyhedron obtained from $V$ by translation by the vector $\\overrightarrow{A_{i} A_{j}}$ does not have common interior points with $V$ (i.e., it can intersect $V$ only on the boundary).\n\n$2^{o}$. No two of the polyhedra $V_{1}, V_{2}, \\ldots, V_{n}$ have common interior points.\n\n$3^{0}$. All $V_{i}$ are contained in $V^{\\prime}$.\n\nLet us prove $1^{o}$. When translated by $\\overrightarrow{A_{i} A_{j}}$, the strip $\\Pi_{i j}$ transforms into a new strip, which does not have common interior points with it - these two strips have only a common boundary plane. But $V$ is contained in $\\Pi_{i j}$, so $1^{0}$ is even more true.\n\n$2^{o}$ immediately follows from $1^{\\circ}$ if we note that $V_{j}$ is obtained from $V_{i}$ by translation by the vector $\\overrightarrow{A_{i} A_{j}}$ (Fig.4). $3^{\\circ}$ follows from a more general fact: if $A B C$ are three points of a convex polyhedron, $W$ and $W^{\\prime}$ is the polyhedron obtained from $W$ by stretching by a factor of 2 with center at point $A$, then the fourth vertex $D$ of the parallelogram $A B D C$ (i.e., the point obtained from $C$ by translation by the vector $\\overrightarrow{A B}$) belongs to $W^{\\prime}$. This fact is easily proven: the point $K$, from which $D$ is obtained by stretching, is the midpoint of segment $A D$ - it is also the midpoint of segment $B C$, so it belongs to $W$ (since the polyhedron $W$ is convex), so $D$ belongs to $W^{\\prime}$ (Fig.5).\n\nThus, statements $2^{o}$ and $3^{o}$ are proven. Let $v$ be the volume of the polyhedron $V$. Then the volume of each of the $V_{i}$ is also equal to $v$, and the volume of $V^{\\prime}$ is equal to $8 v$. From $2^{o}$ and $3^{\\circ}$, it obviously follows that $n v \\leq 8 v$, from which $n \\leq 8$.\n\nNote that in passing, we have solved a problem proposed at the XIII International Olympiad (see \"Kvant\" #12 for 1971, p.54, problem 2). Apparently, the full problem M130 b) was considered too difficult for the Olympiad by the international jury and was excluded, leaving only the first half.\n\nIn connection with the proven statement, a whole series of questions arise, which cannot be solved by the beautiful but rather artificial method we have described. For example, what is the maximum number of points that can be placed in space so that all angles of triangles with vertices at these points are acute? From our solution, it is clear that 8 points cannot be placed (convince yourself of this). It is not difficult to construct an example with 5 points. Can there be 6? A more general and, probably, very difficult question - what is the maximum number of points that can be placed so that all angles do not exceed a given $\\alpha$?\n\nIf any of the readers manage to make progress in solving these questions, we will return to them again.\n\n## Answer\n\nAnswer: a) 4 points, b) 8 points. Examples of such placement of points: a) at the vertices of a square; b) at the vertices of a cube.<|im_end|>\n"}

Let the number of chairs with 3 legs be denoted by $a$, and the number of chairs with 4 legs by $b$. Then, according to the condition of the problem, we have: $3a + 4b + 2(a + b) = 69$. After simplification, we get $5a + 6b = 69$, i.e., $5a = 69 - 6b$. The right side of this equation must yield a natural number that is divisible by 5, i.e., a number that ends in the digit 0 or 5.\n\nThe number $69 - 6b$ cannot end in 0, because the number $6b$ can only end in one of the numbers $6, 2, 8, 4$, or 0.\n\nTherefore, the number $69 - 6b$ must end in the digit 5, i.e., $6b$ must end in 4. The latter is possible if $b = 4, b = 9, b = 14, \\ldots$. Clearly, $b < 12$, because $69 - 6b$ is a natural number.\n\nFinally, $b = 4$ or $b = 9$, so $a = 9$ or $a = 3$, respectively.\n\n## VIII Department<|im_end|>\n"}

However, it is unknown whether there are other functions that meet the requirement.\n\nLet $f$ satisfy the requirement. We hope to determine $f$ through (1) (this condition should be fully utilized). Let $x=y=0$, by (1) we get $f^{2}(0)=f(0)$, so $f(0)=0$ or 1.\nIf $f(0)=0$, then by (1)\n$$\nf\\left(x^{2}\\right)=f(x) f(0)=0,\n$$\n\nwhich means when $x \\geqslant 0$, $f(x)=f\\left((\\sqrt{x})^{2}\\right)=0$.

We only need to consider the values of $f$ on the positive real numbers. At this time,\n$$\nf(x+y)=f\\left((\\sqrt{x})^{2}+(\\sqrt{y})^{2}\\right)=f(\\sqrt{x}) f(\\sqrt{y})=f(x) f(y) .\n$$\n\nIn (2), let $y=x$, we get\n\nAlso,\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}\nf(2 x)=f^{2}(x)=f\\left(2 x^{2}\\right), \\\\\nf(2 x)=f\\left((2 x)^{2}\\right)=f\\left(4 x^{2}\\right),\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nso $f\\left(2 x^{2}\\right)=f\\left(4 x^{2}\\right)$. Let $2 x^{2}=y$, then $f(y)=f(2 y)$ holds for all $y>0$. Therefore, $f^{2}(x)=f(2 x)=f(x), f(x)=0$ or 1.\n\nIf there exists some $y$ such that $f(y)=0$, then by (2), $f(x+y)=0$, i.e., for $x$ greater than $y$, $f(x)=0$.

Explain your reasoning.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Combinatorics, Solution:The 77th problem,\nSolution: Label these points in a clockwise direction as $1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 24$, and arrange them in the following $3 \\times 8$ table:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{cccccccc}\n1 & 4 & 7 & 10 & 13 & 16 & 19 & 22 \\\\\n9 & 12 & 15 & 18 & 21 & 24 & 3 & 6 \\\\\n17 & 20 & 23 & 2 & 5 & 8 & 11 & 14\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nIn the table, the arc length between two adjacent numbers in the same column is 8, and the arc length between two adjacent numbers in the same row is 3 (the first column and the eighth column are also adjacent, as are the first row and the third row). Therefore, in the table, no two adjacent numbers can be taken simultaneously, meaning that only one number can be taken from each column, and exactly one number must be taken.\n\nLet the number of ways to take one number from each column of a $3 \\times n$ number table, such that any two adjacent columns (including the $n$-th column and the first column) do not take numbers from the same row, be denoted as $x_{n}$.\n\nTaking one number from the first column has 3 ways. After the first column is determined, the number taken from the second column cannot be in the same row as the first column, leaving only two different ways. Each subsequent column also has two ways, resulting in a total of $3 \\times 2^{n-1}$ ways. However, all the ways where the numbers taken from the first column and the last column are in the same row do not meet the requirements. In this case, these two columns can be considered as one column, i.e., the number of ways for $n-1$ columns, so $x_{n} + x_{n-1} = 3 \\times 2^{n-1}$. It is also easy to see that $x_{2} = 6$.\n\nRewriting $x_{n} + x_{n-1} = 3 \\times 2^{n-1}$ as $(-1)^{n} x_{n} - (-1)^{n-1} x_{n-1} = -3 \\times (-2)^{n-1}$. Let $y_{n} = (-1)^{n} x_{n}$, then $y_{n} - y_{n-1} = -3 \\times (-2)^{n-1}$, and $y_{2} = 6$. It is easy to solve that $y_{n} = (-2)^{n} + 2$, thus $x_{n} = 2^{n} + 2 \\times (-1)^{n}$.\nTherefore, $x_{8} = 2^{8} + 2 \\times (-1)^{8} = 258$, meaning the total number of ways that meet the requirements of the problem is 258.<|im_end|>\n"}

For \\(n(n-1)\\) to be divisible by 8, we need to ensure that \\(n\\) or \\(n-1\\) is divisible by 8.\n   - This implies that \\(n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}\\).\n\n3. **Construction:**\n   - Let \\(n = 8k + 1\\) for some integer \\(k\\).\n   - Number the players as \\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 8k+1\\}\\).\n   - For each \\(\\ell = 1, 2, \\ldots, 8k+1\\), consider the following 4-tuples where elements are taken such that \\(n+1 \\equiv 1\\):\n     \\[\n     (\\ell, \\ell+4k+1 \\, ; \\, \\ell+1, \\ell+2), \\quad (\\ell, \\ell+4k+1 \\, ; \\, \\ell+3, \\ell+4), \\quad \\ldots, \\quad (\\ell, \\ell+4k+1 \\, ; \\, \\ell+2k-1, \\ell+2k)\n     \\]\n   - This construction ensures that each player plays against every other player exactly once.\n\n4. **Verification:**\n   - There are exactly \\(k(8k+1)\\) 4-tuples\/matches, and they are symmetric in each player.\n   - To verify, check that player 1 plays against every opponent exactly once. This is clear from the construction.\n\n5. **Example:**\n   - For \\(n = 9\\), the construction gives:\n     \\[\n     (1, 6, 2, 3), \\quad (2, 7, 3, 4), \\quad (3, 8, 4, 5), \\quad (4, 9, 5, 6), \\quad (5, 1, 6, 7), \\quad (6, 2, 7, 8), \\quad (7, 3, 8, 9), \\quad (8, 4, 9, 1), \\quad (9, 5, 1, 2)\n     \\]\n\nThe final answer is \\( \\boxed{ n = 8k + 1 } \\) for all \\( k \\in \\mathbb{N} \\).<|im_end|>\n"}

Simon has 2017 blue blocks numbered from 1 to 2017. He also has 2017 yellow blocks numbered from 1 to 2017. Simon wants to arrange his 4034 blocks in a row. He wants to do so in such a way that for every $k=1,2, \\ldots, 2017$ the following conditions are met:\n\n- to the left of the blue block with number $k$ there are $k$ or more yellow blocks;\n- to the right of the yellow block with number $k$ there are $k$ or fewer blue blocks.\n\nDetermine all possible numbers of the 1000th block from the left in the row.\n\n## C-problems\n\nFor the C-problems, not only the answer is important; your reasoning and the way of solving it must also be clearly written down. Solve each C-problem on a separate sheet of paper. Each correctly worked out C-problem is worth 10 points. Partial solutions can also earn points. Therefore, write everything clearly and submit your scratch paper (for each problem!) as well.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Combinatorics, Solution:B5. 500 First, look at the blue block with the number 2017. All yellow blocks must be to the left of it. This also applies to the yellow block with the number 1. To the right of the yellow 1, there can be at most one blue block; this is the blue 2017. We now see that no other blue blocks can lie to the right of the blue 2017. Therefore, the blue 2017 is the rightmost block in the row.\n\nNow, look at the blue block with the number 2016. This lies to the left of the yellow 1 (which we just established). There must be at least 2016 yellow blocks to the left of the blue 2016. These must be the yellow blocks with the numbers 2 to 2017. We now know that the second block from the right must be the yellow 1.\n\nNow, consider the yellow block with the number 2. This yellow block must lie to the left of the blue 2016 and the blue 2017. All other blue blocks must, in turn, lie to the left of the yellow 2. In this way, we find that the third block from the right is the blue 2016.\n\nWe can continue this reasoning and find that there is only one possible row, namely:\n\n$$\nG_{2017}, B_{1}, G_{2016}, B_{2}, \\ldots, G_{2}, B_{2016}, G_{1}, B_{2017}\n$$\n\nThe 1000th block from the left is thus the blue 500.\n\n## C-problems<|im_end|>\n"}

Without loss of generality, and since $a, b$, and $c$ play symmetric roles, we assume that $a \\leqslant b \\leqslant c$, so that $x \\leqslant z \\leqslant y$ and that $x!$ divides both $y!$ and $z!$.\n\nLet $d$ be a divisor of $x!$, that is, a common divisor of $x!, y!$, and $z!$.

This is false, for example, for $n=5$, since $5!-1=119=7 \\times 17$.

A straight rod 2 meters long was sawn into $N$ sticks, the length of each of which is expressed as an integer number of centimeters. For what smallest $N$ can it be guaranteed that, using all the resulting sticks, one can, without breaking them, form the contour of some rectangle?\n\n(A. Magazinov)<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Number Theory, Solution:Answer. $N=102$.\n\nSolution. First solution. Let $N \\leqslant 101$. Cut the stick into $N-1$ sticks of 1 cm each and one stick of $(201-N)$ cm. It is impossible to form a rectangle from this set, as each side of the rectangle is less than half the perimeter, and thus the stick of length $201-N \\geqslant 100$ cm cannot be part of any side. Therefore, $N \\geqslant 102$.\n\nWe will show that for $N=102$, the desired rectangle can be found. Note that among all the sticks, there will be two sticks of 1 cm each. Indeed, if this were not the case, the total length of the sticks would be at least $2 \\cdot 101 + 1 = 203$ cm, which is incorrect.\n\nSet aside these two sticks. Let the lengths of the remaining sticks be $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{100} \\mathrm{~cm}$, then we have $a_{1}+a_{2}+\\ldots+a_{100} = 198$. Among the 100 numbers $A_{1}=a_{1}, A_{2}=a_{1}+a_{2}, A_{3}=a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}, \\ldots, A_{100}=a_{1}+a_{2}+\\ldots+a_{100}$, there will be two that give the same remainder when divided by 99. Let these be $A_{k}$ and $A_{\\ell}, k<\\ell$. The number $A_{\\ell}-A_{k}$ is strictly greater than zero and strictly less than 198, and it is divisible by 99. Thus, $A_{\\ell}-A_{k}=99=a_{k+1}+a_{k+2}+\\ldots+a_{\\ell}$.\n\nThus, we have found several sticks with a total length of $99 \\mathrm{~cm}$. Set these aside as well. The remaining sticks also have a total length of 99 cm. Therefore, we can form a rectangle of $1 \\times 99$ cm.\n\nSecond solution. We will provide another proof that for $N=102$, it is possible to form a rectangle.\n\nLet the lengths of the sticks in the set, expressed in centimeters, be $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{102}$. We have $a_{1}+a_{2}+\\ldots+a_{102}=200$. Consider a circle of length 200 and divide it into 102 red points, forming arcs of lengths $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{102}$. These points are some 102 vertices of a regular 200-gon $T$ inscribed in this circle. The vertices of $T$ are paired into opposite pairs. There are 100 such pairs, and 102 red points, so among the red points, there will be two pairs of opposite points. These two pairs of points divide the circle into two pairs of equal arcs. Thus, we have divided all the sticks into four groups $A, B, C, D$, where the total lengths in groups $A$ and $C$, as well as in groups $B$ and $D$, are equal. Therefore, it is possible to form a rectangle using each group to form one of its sides.\n\nComment. Only the correct answer -0 points.\n\nAn example is provided showing that $N \\geqslant 102-1$ point. It is proven that $N=102$ works, but its minimality is not justified -5 points.<|im_end|>\n"}

Then the number of pairs where the children are of the same gender is $2 a$. Thus, there are $3 a$ pairs in total. The number of pairs is equal to the number of all children, since each child is in two pairs, which gives $2 \\cdot 4 x$ pairs, but we have counted each pair twice, so the number of different pairs is $\\frac{2 \\cdot 4 x}{2}=4 x$.

If they sit together, there are only 2 pairs where a boy and a girl are together, and the remaining pairs are 6. Suppose the girls do not sit together. Consider the cases based on the smallest group of boys sitting together. Since there are 6 boys in total, the smallest group can have at most 3 boys. In all three cases, the number of pairs where the children are of the same gender is equal to the number of pairs where the children are of different genders.\n\nNone of the cases considered meet the conditions of the problem,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\mathrm{B}_{\\mathrm{G}}^{\\mathrm{B}} \\quad \\mathrm{B}^{\\mathrm{G}} \\\\\n& \\begin{array}{llll}\n\\mathrm{B} & \\mathrm{G} & \\mathrm{B} & \\mathrm{G}\n\\end{array} \\\\\n& \\mathrm{B}_{\\mathrm{B}} \\mathrm{B} \\quad \\mathrm{B}_{\\mathrm{B}} \\mathrm{B} \\\\\n& \\mathrm{G}^{\\mathrm{B}} \\quad \\mathrm{B} \\quad \\mathrm{B} \\\\\n& \\begin{array}{llll}\n\\mathrm{B} & \\mathrm{G} & \\mathrm{G} & \\mathrm{G}\n\\end{array} \\\\\n& B_{B} B_{B} \\quad B_{B}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore, at least 3 girls are seated at the table.

Note that, in order for the sum of any three adjacent integers after the rearrangement to be divisible by 3 , any three adjacent integers must be pairwise different modulo 3 . For the original positions of $1,2,3$, there are $3!=6$ possibilities to arrange three numbers taken modulo 3 (i.e. exactly one of these positions is to be occupied by a number divisible by 3 , one by a number congruent to 1 modulo 3 , etc.). The remaining numbers, taken modulo 3 , are then fixed. (For example, if the three numbers occupying the original positions of $1,2,3$ are $8,9,10$, then the twelve numbers modulo 3 in clockwise order starting from the original position of 1 must be 2 , $0,1,2,0,1,2,0,1,2,0,1$.) For each such 'modulo 3 ' arrangement, there are $4!=24$ ways to arrange each of the 4 numbers congruent to 0,1 and 2 modulo 3 .

Calculate the integral\n\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{b} f(x) d x\n$$\n\nwith accuracy $\\alpha$, where $f(x)$ can be expanded into a power series with radius of convergence $R>b$.\n\nPLAN OF SOLUTION. Practical calculations usually boil down to summing a certain numerical series. In this case, such a series is obtained by expanding the integrand in a power series and integrating it term by term.\n\n1. Expand the integrand in a power series in powers of $x$\n\n$$\nf(x)=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} c_{n} x^{n}\n$$\n\nand determine its domain of convergence.\n\n2. A power series can be integrated term by term over any interval belonging to the interval of convergence. Therefore, integrating the obtained series term by term and using the Newton-Leibniz formula, we get\n\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{b} f(x) d x=\\int_{0}^{b} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} c_{n} x^{n} d x=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} c_{n} \\frac{b^{n+1}}{n+1}\n$$\n\n3. Calculate the sum of the numerical series with the given accuracy (by estimating the remainder of the series).\n\nNOTE. If the integrand is expanded in a series not in powers of $x$, but in powers of $x-b \/ 2$, the series will converge faster, i.e., fewer terms may be required to achieve the desired accuracy, but the final calculations will be more complex.<|im_end|>\n"}

Let $\\frac{b+c-a}{2}=x, \\frac{c+a-b}{2}=y, \\frac{a+b-c}{2}=z$.\nThen $x, y, z$ are integers, and $a+b+c=2(x+y+z)$.

Therefore, the right-hand member must also be symmetric, thus\n\n$$\nx^{a} f(y \/ 2)+y^{b} f(x \/ 2)=y^{a} f(x \/ 2)+x^{b} f(y \/ 2)\n$$\n\nfor all positive real numbers $x, y$. Therefore, if $a \\neq b$, there exists $c$ such that $f(x \/ 2) \/\\left(x^{a}-x^{b}\\right)=c$ for all $x \\neq 0,1$. Thus,\n\n$$\nf(x)=c\\left(2^{a} x^{a}-2^{b} x^{b}\\right)\n$$\n\nfor all $x>0$ different from $1 \/ 2$ and 1. We rewrite the functional equation with this expression, and we get\n\n$$\nc^{2}\\left(2^{a} x^{a}-2^{b} x^{b}\\right)\\left(2^{a} y^{a}-2^{b} y^{b}\\right)=c\\left(y^{a} x^{a}-y^{b} x^{b}\\right)\n$$\n\nso $c^{2}\\left(2^{a} x^{a}-2^{b} x^{b}\\right)\\left(2^{a} y^{a}-2^{b} y^{b}\\right)-c\\left(y^{a} x^{a}-y^{b} x^{b}\\right)=0$. We treat this expression as a polynomial in $x$: the coefficients of the same degree must be equal on both sides of the equation (this is true even if $a$ and $b$ are not necessarily integers). The term in $x^{a}$ gives $c^{2} 2^{a}\\left(2^{a} y^{a}-2^{b} y^{b}\\right)-c y^{a}=0$. Treating this as a polynomial in $y$, and looking at the term of degree $b$, we find $c=0$, so $f=0$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{*} \\backslash\\{1 \/ 2,1\\}$. By substituting $x=y=1 \/ 2$ into the initial equation, we have $f(1 \/ 2)=0$. Then $x=y=1 \/ 2$ gives $f(1)=0$, so $f$ is the zero function, which is indeed a solution to the problem.\n\nLet's handle the case $a=b$: with $x=y$ in the initial equation, we get $f(x)^{2}=2 x^{a} f(x \/ 2)$, so $f(x \/ 2)$ is positive for all $x$, so $f$ never takes strictly negative values. Therefore, $f(x)=\\sqrt{2 x^{a} f(x \/ 2)}$. By replacing $f(x)$ and $f(y)$ with this new expression in the initial equation, we get\n\n$$\n4 x^{a} f\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right) y^{a} f\\left(\\frac{y}{2}\\right)=x^{2 a} f\\left(\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^{2}+y^{2 a} f\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^{2}\n$$\n\nwhich can be factored as\n\n$$\n\\left(x^{a} f\\left(\\frac{y}{2}\\right)-y^{a} f\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)\\right)^{2}=0\n$$\n\nThe left-hand member must therefore be zero, which implies that the ratio $f(x \/ 2) \/ x^{a}$ is constant (for non-zero $x$). Therefore, $f(x)=c x^{a}$ for some $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$ (which is also true at $x=0$, because by setting $x=y=0$ in the initial equation, we find $f(0)=0$). Conversely, we see that these functions are solutions to the problem.<|im_end|>\n"}

Since the 51 coins $a_{50}, \\ldots, a_{100}$ are worth at least $51 a_{50}$, it follows that $a_{50} \\leq \\frac{50}{51}$; likewise $a_{51} \\geq \\frac{1}{51}$. We claim that choosing the stacks with coin values \n$$ a_{1}, a_{3}, \\ldots, a_{49}, \\quad a_{52}, a_{54}, \\ldots, a_{100} $$\nand \n$$ a_{2}, a_{4}, \\ldots, a_{50}, \\quad a_{51}, a_{53}, \\ldots, a_{99} $$\nworks. Let $D$ denote the (possibly negative) difference between the two total values. Then \n$$ \\begin{aligned} D & =\\left(a_{1}-a_{2}\\right)+\\cdots+\\left(a_{49}-a_{50}\\right)-a_{51}+\\left(a_{52}-a_{53}\\right)+\\cdots+\\left(a_{98}-a_{99}\\right)+a_{100} \\\\ & \\leq 25 \\cdot 0-\\frac{1}{51}+24 \\cdot 0+1=\\frac{50}{51} \\end{aligned} $$\nSimilarly, we have \n$$ \\begin{aligned} D & =a_{1}+\\left(a_{3}-a_{2}\\right)+\\cdots+\\left(a_{49}-a_{48}\\right)-a_{50}+\\left(a_{52}-a_{51}\\right)+\\cdots+\\left(a_{100}-a_{99}\\right) \\\\ & \\geq 0+24 \\cdot 0-\\frac{50}{51}+25 \\cdot 0=-\\frac{50}{51} \\end{aligned} $$\nIt follows that $|D| \\leq \\frac{50}{51}$, as required.<|im_end|>\n"}

How many solutions in integers $x, y$ does the inequality $|y-x|+|3 x-2 y| \\leq a$ have a) for $a=2$; b) for $a=20$?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Inequalities, Solution:Answer: a) 13; b) 841. Solution. Let $m=y-x, n=3 x-2 y$, then (expressing $x$, y from these equations) we get $x=2 m+n$ and $y=3 m+n$ and thus, for any integers m, n there correspond integers $x, y$ (and vice versa), i.e., there is a one-to-one correspondence between ordered pairs (m.n) and ( $x, y$ ). Therefore, we need to determine how many pairs (m.n) of integers satisfy the inequality $|m|+|n| \\leq a$.\n\na) For $a=2$ such pairs can be easily listed: these are four pairs $( \\pm 1, \\pm 1)$ plus four pairs $( \\pm 1,0)$, $( \\pm 2,0)$ plus four pairs $(0, \\pm 1),(0, \\pm 2)$ and one more zero pair $(0,0)$. In total, there are 13 pairs (m.n), corresponding to 13 solutions of the original inequality. b) First, let's find the number of pairs of natural numbers ( $m . n$ ), for which $m+n=c$ for a given natural $c$. It is easy to see that the number of such pairs is $c-1$ (solutions are the pairs $(1, c-1),(2, c-2), \\ldots,(c-1,1))$. Therefore, the number of pairs of natural numbers satisfying the inequality $m+n \\leq 20$ is $1+2+\\ldots .+19=190$. Then the total number of pairs of non-zero integers satisfying the inequality $|m|+|n| \\leq a$ will be four times greater, i.e., 760. The number of solutions of the form $(m, 0)$ is 41 (these are the pairs $(-20,0),(-19,0) \\ldots,(20,0))$ and, similarly, there are 41 solutions of the form $(0, n)$, but in this case, we counted the zero pair twice. Thus, the total number of solutions is $760+41+40=841$.<|im_end|>\n"}

Their difference is 4, so the larger of the two is $4: 2=2$. The smallest number in the sequence is 6 less than the 7. number, so it is $2-6=-4$.\n\nNow, let's consider that the same absolute value is shared by the 7. and 5. numbers.

Therefore, the faces can only be triangles and quadrilaterals. Let $e$ be the number of edges, and let the number of triangular faces be $k$. Then the number of quadrilateral faces is $5-k$. Counting the edges of the solid face by face, we get twice the number of edges, that is,\n\n$$\n2 e=3 k+4(5-k), \\quad \\text { from which } \\quad k=20-2 e\n$$\n\nTherefore, $k$ is even, and since $k \\leq 5$, only $k=0,2,4$ are possible.\n\nThe case $k=0$ does not provide a solution. Indeed, there is no convex polyhedron with 5 quadrilateral faces. If 4 quadrilateral faces meet at a vertex, the fifth would need to connect to 8 edges, which is impossible. If, however, only 3 quadrilateral faces meet at each vertex, then counting the vertices face by face, the number of vertices would be $\\frac{5 \\cdot 4}{3}$, which is also impossible, as the result is not an integer.\n\nIn the case $k=2$, we are talking about a solid bounded by two triangles and three quadrilaterals. Here, three quadrilateral faces cannot share a vertex, because the two triangles connected by an edge cannot fit their remaining four edges into 6 edges of quadrilaterals. Thus, the two triangles lie \"opposite\" each other. Such a solid can be, for example, a triangular prism, or generally, a truncated 3-sided pyramid.\n\nIn the case $k=4$, a quadrilateral face is connected to a triangular face on each of its sides. This polyhedron is a quadrilateral-based pyramid.\n\nTherefore, there are two types of convex polyhedra with 5 faces.\n\nRemark. Some solvers used Euler's theorem for convex polyhedra, which states that $f+v=e+2$, where $f$ is the number of faces, $v$ is the number of vertices, and $e$ is the number of edges. This gives $v=e-3$. Since at least three edges emanate from each vertex, $3 v \\leq 2 e$, or $v \\leq \\frac{2 e}{3}$. From these two relationships, $\\frac{2 e}{3} \\geq e-3$, and thus $e \\leq 9$. Considering that the number of vertices is at least 5, since the only 4-vertex solid is clearly the tetrahedron, it follows that $e \\geq 8$. Therefore, two cases are possible: $e=8$ or $e=9$. The solution can now be completed similarly to the above.\n\nIn this way, it can also be investigated how many types of convex polyhedra with 6 faces exist. The answer is that there are seven.\n\nThe solution to the problem is also known for polyhedra with 7, 8, and 9 faces, but not for those with more than 9 faces.<|im_end|>\n"}

Find a necessary and sufficient condition on a, b, c for the roots to be cos A, cos B, cos C for some triangle ABC.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Algebra, Solution:If A + B + C = 180 o , then cos A = - cos(B + C) = sin B sin C - cos B cos C. Squaring, we get cos 2 A + cos 2 B + cos 2 C + 2 cos A cos B cos C = 1. So a necessary condition is a 2 - 2b - 2c = 1. Conversely, suppose that this condition holds. Then if the roots are p, q, r, we have p 2 + q 2 + r 2 + 2pqr = 1 (*). We are given that the roots are all positive, so 2pqr > 0, hence p 2 < 1 and so p < 1. Similarly for q and r. So we can find angles A, B, C greater than 0 and less than 90 o such that p = cos A, q = cos B, r = cos C. Now we can rewrite (*) as (1 - cos 2 B)(1 - cos 2 C) = cos 2 A + 2 cos A cos B cos C + cos 2 B cos 2 C = (cos A + cos B cos C) 2 . But (1 - cos 2 B) = sin 2 B, (1 - cos C) = sin 2 C, so we have sin B sin C = \u00b1(cos A + cos B cos C). But we know that A, B, C are between 0 and 90 o , so cos A, cos B, cos C, sin B, sin C are all positive. Hence we must use the + sign and we have cos A = sin B sin C - cos B cos C, so A + B + C = 180 o . Hence the condition is also sufficient. 13th Putnam 1953 \u00a9 John Scholes jscholes@kalva.demon.co.uk 5 Mar 2002<|im_end|>\n"}

Let $P M O$ be a triangle with $P M=2$ and $\\angle P M O=120^{\\circ}$. Let $B$ be a point on $P O$ such that $P M$ is perpendicular to $M B$, and suppose that $P M=B O$. The product of the lengths of the sides of the triangle can be expressed in the form $a+b \\sqrt[3]{c}$, where $a, b, c$ are positive integers, and $c$ is minimized. Find $a+b+c$.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nProblem_type:Geometry, Solution:22. 28\nExtend $P M$ to a point $C$ such that $P C \\perp O C$. Since $\\angle P M O=120^{\\circ}, \\angle C M O=60^{\\circ}$ and $\\angle C O M=30^{\\circ}$. Let $P B=x$ and $M C=a$. Then $C O=a \\sqrt{3}$ and $O M=2 a$. Moreover, $\\triangle P M B$ and $\\triangle P C O$ are similar triangles. Thus, we have\n$$\n\\frac{2}{2+a}=\\frac{x}{x+2}\n$$\nso $x=4 \/ a$.\nFurthermore, by the Cosine Law on side $P O$ of $\\triangle P M O$, we have\n$$\n(x+2)^{2}=4+4 a^{2}+2 a\n$$\n\nPlugging in $x=4 \/ a$ and expanding, we have\n$$\n\\frac{16}{a^{2}}+\\frac{16}{a}+4=4+4 a^{2}+4 a\n$$\nand so $4+4 a=a^{4}+a^{3}$. Hence $a^{3}=4$ and $a=\\sqrt[3]{4}$. Thus, $x=4 \/ \\sqrt[2]{4}$.\nIt follows that the product of the lengths of the sides of the triangle is\n$$\n(2 a)(2)(x+2)=(2 \\sqrt[3]{4})(2)(2 \\sqrt[3]{2}+2)=16+8 \\sqrt[3]{4},\n$$\nso $a+b+c=16+8+4=28$.<|im_end|>\n"}
